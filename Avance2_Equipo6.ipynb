GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS \\n \\n5.1. Each sample shall conform to the specifi cations set forth in paragraphs 6 to 8 \\nbelow. \\n 5.2. Headlamps shall be so made as to  retain their prescribed photometric \\ncharacteristics and to remain in good working order when in normal use, in spite of the vibrations to which they may be subjected. \\n 5.2.1. Headlamps shall be fitted with a device enabling them to be so adjusted on the \\nvehicles as to comply with the rules applicable to them.  Such a device need not be fitted on units in wh ich the reflector and the diffusing lens cannot be \\nseparated, provided the use of such units is confined to vehicles on which the \\nheadlamp setting can be adjusted by other means.  \\n \\n                                                \\n \\n5/  Technical requirements for fila ment lamps: see Regulation No. 37.  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 13   \\n \\n Where a headlamp providing a passing beam and a headlamp providing a \\ndriving beam, each equipped with its ow n filament lamp, are assembled to \\nform a composite unit the adjusting device shall enable each optical system individually to be duly adjusted. \\n 5.2.2. However, these provisions shall not apply to headlamp assemblies whose \\nreflectors are indivisible. For this t ype of assembly the requirements of \\nparagraph 6.3. of this Regulation apply. \\n 5.3. The headlamp shall be equipped with filament lamp(s) approved according to \\nRegulation No. 37.  Any Regulation N o. 37 filament lamp may be used, \\nprovided that no restriction on the applica tion is made in the table of contents \\nof Regulation No. 37. 6\\n/ \\n 5.4. The components by which a filament lamp is fixed to the reflector shall be so \\nmade that, even in darkness, the filament lamp can be fixed in no position but the correct one. 7\\n/ \\n 5.5. The filament lamp holder shall confor m to the characteristics given in IEC \\nPublication 61-2, third edit ion, 1969.  The holder data sheet relevant to the \\ncategory of filament lamp used, applies. \\n 5.6. Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic may be adapted for traffic on a given side of the road either by an \\nappropriate initial setting when fitted on the vehicle or by selective setting by \\nthe user. Such initial or selective setti ng may consist, for example, of fixing \\neither the optical unit at a given angle on the vehicle or the filament lamp at a \\ngiven angle in relation to the optical unit. In all cas es, only two different and \\nclearly distinct settings, one for right-h and and one for left-hand traffic, shall \\nbe possible, and the design shall pr eclude inadvertent shifting from one \\nsetting to the other or setting in an in termediate position. Where two different \\nsetting positions are provided for th e filament lamp, the components for \\nattaching the filament lamp to the re flector must be so designed and made \\n                                                \\n \\n6/  HIR1 and/or H9 filament lamps shall only be permitted to produce passing beam in \\nconjunction with the insta llation of headlamp cleani ng device(s) conforming to \\nRegulation No. 45.  In addition, with respect  to vertical inclin ation, the provision of \\nparagraph 6.2.6.2.2. of Regulation N o. 48, 01 series of amendments, shall not be applied when \\nthese lamps are installed. \\n  This restriction shall apply as long as there is no general agreement on the use of levelling \\ndevices and headlamp cleaners with respect to the level of the perfor mance of the headlamp. \\n7\\n/  A headlamp is regarded as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the filament lamp \\ncan be easily fitted into the headlamp and the pos itioning lugs can be correctly fitted into their \\nslots even in darkness.

Complementary tests shall be done acco rding to the requirements of Annex 4 \\nto ensure that in use there is no exce ssive change in photometric performance. \\n 5.8. If the lens of the headlamp is of plas tic material, tests sh all be done according \\nto the requirements of Annex 6. \\n 5.9. On headlamps designed to provide alte rnately a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, or a passing beam and/or a driv ing beam designed to become bend \\nlighting, any mechanical, el ectromechanical or other device incorporated in \\nthe headlamp for these purposes shall be so constructed that: \\n 5.9.1. the device is strong enough to with stand 50,000 operations without suffering \\ndamage despite the vibrations to whic h it may be subjected in normal use; \\n 5.9.2. in the case of failure the illumination above the line H-H shall not exceed the \\nvalues of a passing beam according to paragraph 6.2.5.; in addition, on headlamps designed to provide a passing and/or a driving beam to become a \\nbend lighting, a minimum illumination of at least 5 lux shall be fulfilled in test point 25 V (VV line, D 75 cm). \\n 5.9.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without \\nany possibility of the mechanis m stopping in between two positions; \\n 5.9.4. the user cannot, with ordi nary tools, change the shape or position of the \\nmoving parts. \\n 6. ILLUMINATION  6.1. General provisions\\n \\n 6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that th ey give adequate illumination without \\ndazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting the driving beam. \\n 6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of \\na vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its \\naxes as shown in Annex 3 to this Regulation. \\n 6.1.3. The headlamps shall be checked by mean s of an uncoloured standard (\\u00e9talon) \\nfilament lamp designed for a rated volta ge of 12 V.  During the checking of  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 15   \\n \\n the headlamp, the voltage at the terminals of the filament lamp shall be \\nregulated so as to obtain the refere nce luminous flux as indicated at the \\nrelevant data sheet of Regulation No. 37. \\n 6.1.4. The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of \\nthis paragraph 6 with at least one sta ndard (\\u00e9talon) filament lamp, which may \\nbe submitted with the headlamp. \\n 6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:  6.2.2.1. in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand \\ntraffic, the \\\"cut-off\\\" on the left-half of the screen 8\\n/ is horizontal and, in the \\ncase of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left -hand traffic, the \\n\\\"cut-off\\\" on the right-half of the screen is horizontal; \\n 6.2.2.2. this horizontal part of the \\\"cut-off\\\" is  situated on the sc reen 25 cm below the \\nlevel hh (see Annex 3);  \\n \\n6.2.2.3. the \\\"elbow\\\" of the \\\"c ut-off\\\" is on line vv. 9\\n/ \\n 6.2.3. When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely for \\nprovision of a passing beam, 10\\n/ comply only with the requirements set out in  \\n                                                 \\n8/  The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the \\\"cut-off\\\" over a range of \\nat least 5\\u00b0 on either side of the line vv. \\n \\n9/  If the beam does not have a cut-off with a clear \\\"elbow\\\", the lateral adjustment shall be \\neffected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for illumination at points 75 R and \\n50 R for right-hand traffic and for points  75 L and 50 L for left-hand traffic. \\n 10\\n/  Such a special \\\"passing beam\\\" headlamp ma y incorporate a driving beam not subject to \\nrequirements.

Where a headlamp so aimed does not meet the requirements set out in \\nparagraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and 6.3., its alignment may be changed, provided that the axis of the beam is not displ aced laterally by more than 1\\u00b0 (= 44 cm) \\nto the right or left. 11\\n/ To facilitate alignment by means of the \\\"cut-off\\\", the \\nheadlamp may be partially occulted in order to sharpen the \\\"cut-off\\\". \\n 6.2.5. The illumination produced on the screen by the passing beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements: \\n \\n6.2.6. There shall be no lateral va riations detrimental to good visibility in any of the \\nzones I, II, III and IV. \\n 6.2.7. The illumination values in zones \\\"A\\\" and \\\"B\\\" as shown in figure C in \\nAnnex 3 shall be checked by the measur ement of the photometric values of \\n                                                \\n \\n11/  The limit of realignment of 1\\u00b0 towards the right  or left is not incompatible with upward or \\ndownward vertical realig nment.  The latter is limited only by the requirements of paragraph 6.3. \\nHowever, the horizontal part of the \\\"cut -off\\\" should not extend beyond the line hh \\n(the provisions of paragra ph 6.3. are not applicable to h eadlamps intended to meet the \\nrequirements of this Regulation only for provision of a passing beam).

The requirements in paragraph 6.2.5. above shall also ap ply to headlamps \\ndesigned to provide bend lighting and/or  that include the additional light \\nsource referred to in paragraph 6.2.10.2. \\n 6.2.9.1. If bend lighting is obtained by:  6.2.9.1.1. swivelling the passing beam or moving horizontally the kink  of the elbow of \\nthe cut-off, the measurements shall be carried out after the complete \\nheadlamp assembly has been reai med horizontally, e.g. by means of a \\ngoniometer; \\n 6.2.9.1.2. moving one or more optical parts of the headlamp without moving \\nhorizontally the kink of the elbow of the cut-off, measurements shall be \\ncarried out with these parts being in their extreme operating position; \\n \\n6.2.9.1.3. means of one additional light source without moving horizontally the kink of \\nthe elbow of the cut-off, measurements shall be carried out with this light \\nsource activated. \\n 6.2.10. Only one principal light source is pe rmitted for each passing beam headlamp.  \\nHowever, a maximum of two additional light sources are permitted as follows: \\n 6.2.10.1. One additional light source inside the passing beam headlamp according to \\nRegulation No. 37 may be used to  contribute to  bend lighting. \\n \\n                                                \\n \\n12/  Illumination values in any point of zones A a nd B, which also lies within zone III, shall not \\nexceed 0.7 lux.

One additional light source according to Regulation No. 37, inside the passing \\nbeam headlamp, may be used for the purposes of generating infrared radiation.  It shall only be activated at  the same time as the principal light \\nsource.  In the event that the principal light source fails, this additional light source shall be automatically switched off. \\n 6.2.10.3. In the event of failure of an addi tional light source, the headlamp shall \\ncontinue to fulfil the requirements of the passing beam. \\n 6.3. Provisions concerning driving beams\\n \\n 6.3.1. In the case of a headlamp designed to  provide a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, measurements of the illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall be taken with the same headlamp alignment as for measurements under paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. above; in the case of a \\nheadlamp providing a driving beam only, it shall be so adjusted that the area \\nof maximum illumination is centred on th e point of intersection of lines hh \\nand vv; such a headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in \\nparagraph 6.3. \\n 6.3.2. It is possible to use several light sources for the driving beam.  6.3.3. The illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements. \\n 6.3.3.1. The point of intersection (HV) of lines hh and vv shall be si tuated within the \\nisolux 80 per cent of maximum illumination. This maximum value (E\\nM) shall \\nnot be less than 32 lux for Class A headlamps and 48 lux for Class B \\nheadlamps.  The maximum value shall in no circumstances exceed 240 lux; in \\naddition, in the case of a combined passing and driving headlamp, this \\nmaximum value shall not be more than  16 times the illumination measured for \\nthe passing beam at point 75 R (or 75 L). \\n 6.3.3.1.1. The maximum intensity (I\\nM) of the driving beam e xpressed in thousands of \\ncandelas shall be calculated by the formula: \\n  I\\nM = 0.625 E M \\n 6.3.3.1.2. The reference mark (I\\n'\\nM) of this maximum intensity, referred to in \\nparagraph 4.2.2.7. above, shall be obtained by the ratio: \\n \\n  \\n \\n I'I\\n30.208  EMM\\nM == E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 19   \\n \\n This value shall be rounded off to the value 7.5 - 10 - 12.5 - 17.5 - 20 - 25 - \\n27.5 - 30 - 37.5 - 40 - 45 - 50. \\n 6.3.3.2.

In the case of headlamps with adju stable reflector the requirements of \\nparagraphs 6.2. and 6.3. are applicable for each mounting position indicated according to paragraph 2.1.3.  For verifi cation the following procedure shall \\nbe used: \\n 6.4.1. Each applied position is realized on the test goniometer with respect to a line \\njoining the centre of the light source  and point HV on a aiming screen.  The \\nadjustable reflector is then moved into such a position that the light pattern on \\nthe screen corresponds to the aiming pr escriptions of paragraphs 6.2.1. to \\n6.2.2.3. and/or 6.3.1; \\n 6.4.2. with the reflector initially fixed acco rding to paragraph 6.4.1., the headlamp \\nmust meet the relevant photometric re quirements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3; \\n \\n6.4.3. additional tests are made after the reflector has been moved vertically \\u00b1 2\\u00b0 or \\nat least into the maximum position, if less than 2\\u00b0, from its initial position by \\nmeans of the headlamps adjusting device. Having re-aimed the headlamp as a whole (by means of the goniometer fo r example) in the corresponding \\nopposite direction the light output in the following directions shall be \\ncontrolled and lie within the required limits: \\n \\npassing beam : points HV and 75 R (75 L respectively); driving beam : E\\nM and point HV (percentage of E M). \\n \\n6.4.4. if the applicant has not indicated more than one mounting position,  the \\nprocedure of paragraphs 6.4.1. to 6.4.3. shall be repeated for all other \\npositions; \\n 6.4.5. if the applicant has no t asked for special mounti ng positions, the headlamp \\nshall be aimed for measurements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3. with the \\nheadlamps adjusting device in its m ean position.  The additional test of \\nparagraph 6.4.3. shall be made with the reflector moved into its extreme positions (instead of \\n+ 2\\u00b0) by means of the headlamps adjusting device. \\n 6.5. The screen illumination values mentioned in paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and \\n6.3. above shall be measured by means of a photo receptor, the effective area of which shall be contained within a square of 65 mm side.

Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

Energize the low beam filament at 12.8 V DC and visually adjust the aim of \\nthe headlamp until the upper cutoff at 2 \\u00b0R is on the horizontal (0.0 \\u00b0D) for \\nVOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L is at 0.4 \\u00b0D for VOL . \\nThis aiming should be done on a test screen at least 25 feet from the lamp. \\n2. Fine tune the aim using the com puter software by scanning in  0.10 \\u00b0 \\nincrements from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to 1.5 \\u00b0 D at 2\\u00b0 R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL to \\ndetermine the point at which the maximum gradient occurs. \\nUse software or the following formula to find the maximum gradient: G=logE(a) - logE(a+0.1)           where G=gradient,  a=vetical angular position (degrees) , E(a)=candela. The maximum gradient must \\\"be not less than .13\\u2026\\\" otherwise record that the \\nCENTER GRADIENT FAILED.  \\n3. After finding the vertical location of the maximum gradient, the software/ \\noperator must set: a) the maximum gradient of VOR headlamps to be at the \\nvertical zero (0.0 \\u00b0D) of the goniometer, or b) the maximum gradient of VOL \\nheadlamps to be at 0.4D. \\n4.

This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.

The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.  These bulbs are reca librated per G805-LL-C-001in accord with SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.8.3, except the annual recalibration has been replaced with a \\noperating time based calibration, which is  based on the interval recommended by the \\ncalibrating laboratory. \\n7. Note, that  there are filament or light source parameters that are not controlled in \\naccurate rated bulbs and these parameter s in \\\"some lighting devices may produce \\nsignificantly different luminous intensity measurements with two different accurate \\nrated bulbs, particularly lighting devices wi th particularly short focal lengths.\\\" SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.6). \\n8. The sensor/photometer system is desi gned and used within the guidelines for color \\nresponse, HID source use, range linearit y and sensor aperture size that are \\ncontained within SAE J1330 JUN94 sections 3. 7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3,  3.7.4 and 3.7.5.

CONTROL PLAN - \\n \\nThe Manufacturing Plant and Viste on Product Engineering Office will jo intly determine which potential \\nprocess changes would have signi ficant impact on the product's func tion, performance, durability or \\nappearance.  The manufacturing plant will describe th ese process changes in th e Control Plan, along with \\neither (1) the revalidation plan th at would be followed in each case, or (2) a provision to submit an \\namended Control Plan for approval if any of those pr ocess changes are planned. No change to processing \\nmay be allowed without prior engineering approval of the process changes and the attendant Control Plan \\nchanges.   \\nB. DESIGN CHANGES - \\n Any changes in material or material sources must be revalidated for durability and material compatibility.  Any changes in material, design or tooling must be evaluated for their potential impact on: \\n1)  the real world safety of the vehicle,  \\n2)  the homologation status of the vehicle,  \\n3)  the self certification status  per FMVSS/CMVSS/ADR/etc.,  \\n4)  the ability to meet the customers safety design guidelines,  \\n5)  the crash performance of the vehicle and/or component and \\n6)  the customers safety related compliance requirements, i.e. WCR. \\n \\nThe potential impact of any of the above fact ors should be communicated  in writing to both: \\na)  the customer safety/regulatory representative via WERS or equivalent or email and  \\nb)  the Regulatory Compliance Engineer for Exterior Lighting  \\nwho shall provide assistance in determining what tests must be done (if any) to demonstrate that certification and/or homologation complia nce, safety factors/acceptance crite ria and safety related customer \\nrequirements have not been compromised.  \\n  \\nC.  AIMING PAD (NIB) EVALUATION - \\n \\nConduct an annual engineering evalua tion.  A suggested amount of 3 pair/cavity combination of each \\nheadlamp shall be submitted to the product engineering lighting laboratory for verifi cation of correct aim.  \\nIf the aim is found outside acceptable limits the amount of  adjustment required to the aiming pads will be \\nprovided by engineering.  \\n  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

Production Lot - The total number of parts per hand, per cavity, per carline, manufactured during one  \\nproduction shift.  \\n B. Production Unit - The total number of parts of one type produced by one manufacturing group of \\nmachines (assembly line during one production shift). \\n C. Prime Source - The plant where the part is act ually being manufactured, or that plant which  \\n performs the operation which controls the characteristics.  The part may not necessarily be supplied  directly to the customer, but may be shipped to a second supplier or manufacturing plant.  In some \\ninstances, an OEM plant ma y be the prime source. \\n D. Replaceable Bulb Headlamp - Shall include h eadlamp assembly (13005-6) , wiring connector male \\nsleeve assembly (14A464) and 16 gage wire (ESF-MIL 56A) unless specified otherwise.  For testing, \\nheadlamp breathing devices or other design openi ngs shall be in their normal operating positions \\nunless otherwise specified. \\n E. Seasoning -   Process of energizing the filament of a headlamp at design voltage for a period of time  equivalent to 1% of average rated laboratory life.  Other equivalent methods are acceptable. \\n F.           Control Plans address all significant design and process characteristics, including all Control Item \\ncharacteristics.  They describe the process pot ential studies that will be performed for product \\nvalidation (including certification and PSW tests)  and the ongoing product and process evaluation for \\ncontinuing improvement (i ncluding IP tests).  They include  acceptance criteria, sample sizes, \\nfrequencies, data analysis methods and reaction plans. \\n \\nThe Control Plan is developed, and updated as necessary, by the ma nufacturing source in conjunction  \\n with the design responsible Product Engineering ac tivity and other appropriate functions such as \\nSTA. The Control Plan defines the management of th e upstream production process and part variables \\n (significant process characteristics)  that affect the outcome of the laboratory tests or other significant \\ndesign characteristics.  The Control Plan also identifies the specific laboratory tests, with their sample \\nsizes and frequencies, that will be performed in order to: \\n \\n        . Confirm whether the process is being managed effectively.         . Further identify significant process characteristics. \\n        . Evaluate performance of marginal processes.         .

Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:  6.2.2.1. in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand \\ntraffic, the \\\"cut-off\\\" on the left-half of the screen 8\\n/ is horizontal and, in the \\ncase of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left -hand traffic, the \\n\\\"cut-off\\\" on the right-half of the screen is horizontal; \\n 6.2.2.2. this horizontal part of the \\\"cut-off\\\" is  situated on the sc reen 25 cm below the \\nlevel hh (see Annex 3);  \\n \\n6.2.2.3. the \\\"elbow\\\" of the \\\"c ut-off\\\" is on line vv. 9\\n/ \\n 6.2.3. When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely for \\nprovision of a passing beam, 10\\n/ comply only with the requirements set out in  \\n                                                 \\n8/  The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the \\\"cut-off\\\" over a range of \\nat least 5\\u00b0 on either side of the line vv. \\n \\n9/  If the beam does not have a cut-off with a clear \\\"elbow\\\", the lateral adjustment shall be \\neffected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for illumination at points 75 R and \\n50 R for right-hand traffic and for points  75 L and 50 L for left-hand traffic. \\n 10\\n/  Such a special \\\"passing beam\\\" headlamp ma y incorporate a driving beam not subject to \\nrequirements.

Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

Headlamps:  All bulbs used for photomet ric testing must have lower and/or upper \\nbeam filaments (if any) positioned within +/ - 0.125 mm (0.005 inch) axially, vertically \\nand horizontally of design location relative to  the lamp socket.  This specification is \\ntighter than is required by applicable regulations. \\n2. Non-Headlamps:  All replaceable, i.e.  non-sealed in lamp, bulbs must have the \\nfilaments (if any) positioned within +/- 0. 25 mm (0.010 inch) axially, vertically and \\nhorizontally of design location relative to the lamp, as specified in SAE J573d or by \\nthe bulb manufacturer.  \\nNOTE: This requirement derives fr om the FMVSS/CMVSS regulation which \\nreferences SAE J575e (Aug. 1980) (which references SAE J387). \\n \\n(b) Conditioning:  All bulbs used for photomet ric and wattage tests must be conditioned before \\nthe first use by operating at nominal design voltage for one percent of their average rated \\nlaboratory life.   \\n(c) On-Time: \\n1. Incandescent filament(s), allow a minimum of three minutes to stabilize the output of \\nthe bulb(s) prior to making maximum and minimum measurements. \\n2. Other light emitting devices, determi ne their performance characteristics in \\nrelationship to light output vs. time. Measur e and record the light output of the device \\nfor the worst case condition if significant changes in performance occur and document the duration of the on-time. \\n3. LED lighting devices, measure and reco rd the maximum output of the device \\nimmediately (within 60 sec.) after applying pow er to the device; allow internal heat \\nbuildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization time,  prior to measuring and recording individual test point data; and for the dust test, measure and record the maximum output of the device after internal heat bu ildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization \\ntime. \\nNOTE: This requirement der ives from SAE J1889 Oct93.

The \\n1/4 degree re-aim (tolerance of 0.25 degrees) is  considered to mean within a cone with a \\n1/4 degree radius . \\n5.1.1. Low-Beam Photometry \\n(a) Mount the alignment test fixture on the loca ting pins of the goniometer, with the low beam \\nfocal point at the center.  Adjust the height  of the goniometer so that the sample\\u2019s \\nmechanical axis is the same height as the photodetector. \\n(b) Rotate the goniometer to the aiming plane position. (c) Aim the Low Beam using the appropriate headlamp aim system from (c) 1), 2),  3) or 4)  \\n1. Aiming External Aim Headlamps:  headlamps  which use separate, external aimers \\nthat rest on the headlamps aiming pads (nibs), includes sealed beams\\n. \\nA) Install a mirror on the surface of the aiming pads. B) Turn on a laser positioned at a known location relative to the H-V axis and \\nadjust the aiming plane of the headlamp to  0,0 by rotating the aiming screws. \\nC) Remove the mirror. D) Install a nominal bulb in the headlamp assembly. \\nNOTE: In the future multiple light sources may be permitted, if they are \\nlegal and required by a particular design and some sources are independently adjustable in relation to the first, repeat the previous steps for the additional independently aimable light sources. \\ne) Go to step 5.1.1.(d) Low beam Measurement  \\n2.

Use the \\nmirror on the slave fixture to reset t he horizontal zero. Mount the headlamp on \\nthe test fixture. \\nb) Adjust the vertical aim of t he \\\"VOR\\\" or \\\"VOL\\\" headlamp as follows: \\n1. Energize the low beam filament at 12.8 V DC and visually adjust the aim of \\nthe headlamp until the upper cutoff at 2 \\u00b0R is on the horizontal (0.0 \\u00b0D) for \\nVOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L is at 0.4 \\u00b0D for VOL . \\nThis aiming should be done on a test screen at least 25 feet from the lamp. \\n2. Fine tune the aim using the com puter software by scanning in  0.10 \\u00b0 \\nincrements from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to 1.5 \\u00b0 D at 2\\u00b0 R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL to \\ndetermine the point at which the maximum gradient occurs. \\nUse software or the following formula to find the maximum gradient: G=logE(a) - logE(a+0.1)           where G=gradient,  a=vetical angular position (degrees) , E(a)=candela. The maximum gradient must \\\"be not less than .13\\u2026\\\" otherwise record that the \\nCENTER GRADIENT FAILED.  \\n3.

The meas urements should use the \\u00bc reaim permitted \\nif a value exceeding the maximum is found. \\nNOTE: Where the 10U-90U area is specified  instead of a test point, the \\nmeasurement should be across the specifi ed horizontal line and up a vertical line \\nstarting on the horizontal line where the maximum intensity reading was \\nobtained.  These measurements should use the 1 degree reaim (2 degree cone) \\npermitted in Step 6 .  \\n5.

This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6. Visually locate\\n within the region 10U to 90U - L to R any areas that are receiving \\nexcessively bright light. If such an area ex ists, scan the bright area to locate the \\napparent maximum intensity location and record the candlepower value and the position. Also record the candlepower va lue and position of all points within a 1 \\ndegree radius about the apparent maximum intensity location at 0.125 degree intervals. Find the actual highest intensity location by determining the center of the \\nhighest values obtained.  \\nActual highest intensity cd values that  are greater than 438 cd should be noted as \\nexceeding the maximum (FAIL), in addition, values exceeding 125 cd should also be \\nmarked as exceeding the maximum (FAIL), unless a 125 cd or lower value can be \\nfound within a 2 degree cone (1 degree reai m) around the actual highest intensity.  \\nNOTE:  The 2 degree cone is defined in  the rationale of  SAE J1383 JUN 90 and \\nalso in ECE R48 as the maximum area of spots of light that can exceed \\nthe maximum candlepower applied, i.e. 125 cd, to portions of the beam  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

NHTSA's Pat Boyd \\nannounced at the Fall 1997 SAE Lighting Committee meeting that the \\nrewrite of FMVSS 108 in 1998 will allow a maximum of 438 cd within a 2 \\ndegree cone for all low beam headlamps.  This was confirmed by \\nNHTSA's Rich Van Iderstine on 5/27/98 after he consulted with Pat \\nBoyd.  Therefore, this criteria can confidently be used for, at least, all \\nheadlamps that are for 1999 model vehicles or later.  \\n7.

The Product \\nEngineer must supply a pitch angle number and tolerance OR both upward and downward pitch angle numbers that he wants to certify the vehicle to.  The vehicle pitch number(s) submitted and used for testing should must be equal to or greater than the vehicle pitch number(s) of the vehicle approved fo r production.

Design voltage is the nominal voltage that t he vehicle will supply to the connector for the \\ncomponent.  North American Tail lamps are ty pically 14.0V and stop lamps are typically \\n12.8V.  However, ask the OEM to specify the nominal design voltage for the function \\nwhich could be different for the wiring, swit ching, resistors, voltage reduction modules \\netc. \\n  2. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage for 30 min, THEN run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with mi nimum requirements.   Also determine the \\nmaximum intensity location. \\n \\n3. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage and IMMEDIATELY run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with maxi mum requirements within 60 seconds, that is \\nbetween 0 and 60.49 seconds).   \\n \\n4. For lamps like CHMSLs with a maximum zone (10L to 10R and from 10U to 5D) (typically \\nalso equal to the furthest test points), test the PREDETERMINED maximum location \\nwithin the zone.  Give a 1/4 degree reaim to any test point or maximum intensity location \\nthat exceeds that maximum permitted candela.   Any test measurement which exceeds \\nthe maximum shall be remeasured at a time approaching, but not exceeding 60.49 \\nseconds, i.e. 50-60 seconds, since test meas urements taken it the earlier part of the \\nallotted 60 seconds, i.e., 0-10 or even at  10-20 seconds, may be higher than would be \\nobtained later in the allotted time period.  If multiple test points have maximums, it is \\npermitted to repeat the test at many times as  necessary to test all test points with \\nmaximums within the latter portion of the allotted time, i.e., 50-60 seconds. \\n \\n5. CHMSLs shall meet the photometric mini mums of FMVSS 108 Table 10; note the test \\npoint and zones are the same as SAEJ 1957 JUN 93, but the maximums are \\nDIFFERENT.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.

The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.  These bulbs are reca librated per G805-LL-C-001in accord with SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.8.3, except the annual recalibration has been replaced with a \\noperating time based calibration, which is  based on the interval recommended by the \\ncalibrating laboratory. \\n7. Note, that  there are filament or light source parameters that are not controlled in \\naccurate rated bulbs and these parameter s in \\\"some lighting devices may produce \\nsignificantly different luminous intensity measurements with two different accurate \\nrated bulbs, particularly lighting devices wi th particularly short focal lengths.\\\" SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.6). \\n8. The sensor/photometer system is desi gned and used within the guidelines for color \\nresponse, HID source use, range linearit y and sensor aperture size that are \\ncontained within SAE J1330 JUN94 sections 3. 7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3,  3.7.4 and 3.7.5.

Headlamps shall be fitted with a device enabling them to be so adjusted on the \\nvehicles as to comply with the rules applicable to them.  Such a device need not be fitted on units in wh ich the reflector and the diffusing lens cannot be \\nseparated, provided the use of such units is confined to vehicles on which the \\nheadlamp setting can be adjusted by other means.  \\n \\n                                                \\n \\n5/  Technical requirements for fila ment lamps: see Regulation No. 37.  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 13   \\n \\n Where a headlamp providing a passing beam and a headlamp providing a \\ndriving beam, each equipped with its ow n filament lamp, are assembled to \\nform a composite unit the adjusting device shall enable each optical system individually to be duly adjusted. \\n 5.2.2. However, these provisions shall not apply to headlamp assemblies whose \\nreflectors are indivisible. For this t ype of assembly the requirements of \\nparagraph 6.3. of this Regulation apply. \\n 5.3. The headlamp shall be equipped with filament lamp(s) approved according to \\nRegulation No. 37.  Any Regulation N o. 37 filament lamp may be used, \\nprovided that no restriction on the applica tion is made in the table of contents \\nof Regulation No. 37. 6\\n/ \\n 5.4. The components by which a filament lamp is fixed to the reflector shall be so \\nmade that, even in darkness, the filament lamp can be fixed in no position but the correct one. 7\\n/ \\n 5.5. The filament lamp holder shall confor m to the characteristics given in IEC \\nPublication 61-2, third edit ion, 1969.  The holder data sheet relevant to the \\ncategory of filament lamp used, applies. \\n 5.6. Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic may be adapted for traffic on a given side of the road either by an \\nappropriate initial setting when fitted on the vehicle or by selective setting by \\nthe user. Such initial or selective setti ng may consist, for example, of fixing \\neither the optical unit at a given angle on the vehicle or the filament lamp at a \\ngiven angle in relation to the optical unit. In all cas es, only two different and \\nclearly distinct settings, one for right-h and and one for left-hand traffic, shall \\nbe possible, and the design shall pr eclude inadvertent shifting from one \\nsetting to the other or setting in an in termediate position. Where two different \\nsetting positions are provided for th e filament lamp, the components for \\nattaching the filament lamp to the re flector must be so designed and made \\n                                                \\n \\n6/  HIR1 and/or H9 filament lamps shall only be permitted to produce passing beam in \\nconjunction with the insta llation of headlamp cleani ng device(s) conforming to \\nRegulation No. 45.  In addition, with respect  to vertical inclin ation, the provision of \\nparagraph 6.2.6.2.2. of Regulation N o. 48, 01 series of amendments, shall not be applied when \\nthese lamps are installed. \\n  This restriction shall apply as long as there is no general agreement on the use of levelling \\ndevices and headlamp cleaners with respect to the level of the perfor mance of the headlamp. \\n7\\n/  A headlamp is regarded as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the filament lamp \\ncan be easily fitted into the headlamp and the pos itioning lugs can be correctly fitted into their \\nslots even in darkness.

Complementary tests shall be done acco rding to the requirements of Annex 4 \\nto ensure that in use there is no exce ssive change in photometric performance. \\n 5.8. If the lens of the headlamp is of plas tic material, tests sh all be done according \\nto the requirements of Annex 6. \\n 5.9. On headlamps designed to provide alte rnately a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, or a passing beam and/or a driv ing beam designed to become bend \\nlighting, any mechanical, el ectromechanical or other device incorporated in \\nthe headlamp for these purposes shall be so constructed that: \\n 5.9.1. the device is strong enough to with stand 50,000 operations without suffering \\ndamage despite the vibrations to whic h it may be subjected in normal use; \\n 5.9.2. in the case of failure the illumination above the line H-H shall not exceed the \\nvalues of a passing beam according to paragraph 6.2.5.; in addition, on headlamps designed to provide a passing and/or a driving beam to become a \\nbend lighting, a minimum illumination of at least 5 lux shall be fulfilled in test point 25 V (VV line, D 75 cm). \\n 5.9.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without \\nany possibility of the mechanis m stopping in between two positions; \\n 5.9.4. the user cannot, with ordi nary tools, change the shape or position of the \\nmoving parts. \\n 6. ILLUMINATION  6.1. General provisions\\n \\n 6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that th ey give adequate illumination without \\ndazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting the driving beam. \\n 6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of \\na vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its \\naxes as shown in Annex 3 to this Regulation. \\n 6.1.3. The headlamps shall be checked by mean s of an uncoloured standard (étalon) \\nfilament lamp designed for a rated volta ge of 12 V.  During the checking of  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 15   \\n \\n the headlamp, the voltage at the terminals of the filament lamp shall be \\nregulated so as to obtain the refere nce luminous flux as indicated at the \\nrelevant data sheet of Regulation No. 37. \\n 6.1.4. The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of \\nthis paragraph 6 with at least one sta ndard (étalon) filament lamp, which may \\nbe submitted with the headlamp. \\n 6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \"cut-off\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \"cut-off\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45° angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15° above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:  6.2.2.1. in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand \\ntraffic, the \"cut-off\" on the left-half of the screen 8\\n/ is horizontal and, in the \\ncase of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left -hand traffic, the \\n\"cut-off\" on the right-half of the screen is horizontal; \\n 6.2.2.2. this horizontal part of the \"cut-off\" is  situated on the sc reen 25 cm below the \\nlevel hh (see Annex 3);  \\n \\n6.2.2.3. the \"elbow\" of the \"c ut-off\" is on line vv. 9\\n/ \\n 6.2.3.

In the case of a headlamp designed to  provide a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, measurements of the illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall be taken with the same headlamp alignment as for measurements under paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. above; in the case of a \\nheadlamp providing a driving beam only, it shall be so adjusted that the area \\nof maximum illumination is centred on th e point of intersection of lines hh \\nand vv; such a headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in \\nparagraph 6.3. \\n 6.3.2. It is possible to use several light sources for the driving beam.  6.3.3. The illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements. \\n 6.3.3.1. The point of intersection (HV) of lines hh and vv shall be si tuated within the \\nisolux 80 per cent of maximum illumination. This maximum value (E\\nM) shall \\nnot be less than 32 lux for Class A headlamps and 48 lux for Class B \\nheadlamps.  The maximum value shall in no circumstances exceed 240 lux; in \\naddition, in the case of a combined passing and driving headlamp, this \\nmaximum value shall not be more than  16 times the illumination measured for \\nthe passing beam at point 75 R (or 75 L). \\n 6.3.3.1.1. The maximum intensity (I\\nM) of the driving beam e xpressed in thousands of \\ncandelas shall be calculated by the formula: \\n  I\\nM = 0.625 E M \\n 6.3.3.1.2.

In the case of headlamps with adju stable reflector the requirements of \\nparagraphs 6.2. and 6.3. are applicable for each mounting position indicated according to paragraph 2.1.3.  For verifi cation the following procedure shall \\nbe used: \\n 6.4.1. Each applied position is realized on the test goniometer with respect to a line \\njoining the centre of the light source  and point HV on a aiming screen.  The \\nadjustable reflector is then moved into such a position that the light pattern on \\nthe screen corresponds to the aiming pr escriptions of paragraphs 6.2.1. to \\n6.2.2.3. and/or 6.3.1; \\n 6.4.2. with the reflector initially fixed acco rding to paragraph 6.4.1., the headlamp \\nmust meet the relevant photometric re quirements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3; \\n \\n6.4.3. additional tests are made after the reflector has been moved vertically ± 2° or \\nat least into the maximum position, if less than 2°, from its initial position by \\nmeans of the headlamps adjusting device. Having re-aimed the headlamp as a whole (by means of the goniometer fo r example) in the corresponding \\nopposite direction the light output in the following directions shall be \\ncontrolled and lie within the required limits: \\n \\npassing beam : points HV and 75 R (75 L respectively); driving beam : E\\nM and point HV (percentage of E M). \\n \\n6.4.4. if the applicant has not indicated more than one mounting position,  the \\nprocedure of paragraphs 6.4.1. to 6.4.3. shall be repeated for all other \\npositions; \\n 6.4.5. if the applicant has no t asked for special mounti ng positions, the headlamp \\nshall be aimed for measurements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3. with the \\nheadlamps adjusting device in its m ean position.  The additional test of \\nparagraph 6.4.3. shall be made with the reflector moved into its extreme positions (instead of \\n+ 2°) by means of the headlamps adjusting device. \\n 6.5. The screen illumination values mentioned in paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and \\n6.3. above shall be measured by means of a photo receptor, the effective area of which shall be contained within a square of 65 mm side.

PURPOSE AND APPLICATION  \\n \\nThe Office of Vehicle Safety Comp liance (OVSC) provides contractor \\nlaboratories with Laboratory  Test Procedures as guidelines for obtaining \\ncompliance test data.  The data is used to determine if a specific vehicle or item \\nof motor vehicle equipment is potent ially non-compliant  with an applicable \\nFederal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS).  The purpose of the OVSC Laboratory Test Procedures is  to present a uniform testing and data recording \\nformat, and provide suggestions for t he use of specific equipment and \\nprocedures.  If any contractor view s any part of an OVSC Laboratory Test \\nProcedure to be in conflict with a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) or observes deficiencies in a Labor atory Test Procedure,  the contractor \\nis required to advise the Contracting Offi cer\\'s Technical Representative (COTR) \\nand resolve the discrepancy prior to t he start of compliance testing. \\n \\nEvery contractor is required to submit  a detailed test procedure to the COTR \\nbefore initiating the compliance test program.  The procedure must include a \\nstep-by-step description of the methodology  to be used.  The contractor’s test \\nprocedure shall contain a complete lis ting of test equipment with make and \\nmodel number and a detailed check-off shee t.  The list of test equipment shall \\ninclude instrument accuracy and calibra tion dates.  All equipment shall be \\ncalibrated in accordance with the manufactu rer’s instructions.  There shall be no \\ncontradictions between t he Laboratory Test Procedure an d the contractor’s in-\\nhouse test procedure.  Writt en approval of the in-house te st procedures shall be \\nobtained from the COTR before initiating the compliance test program.  The \\nOVSC Laboratory Test Pr ocedures are not intended to limit or restrain a \\ncontractor from developing or utilizing any testing te chniques or equipment which \\nwill assist in procuring the required comp liance test data.  These Laboratory Test \\nProcedures do not constitute an endorseme nt or recommendation for use of any \\nproduct or method.  However, the applicat ion of any such testing technique or \\nequipment is subject to pr ior approval of the COTR. \\n \\nNOTE:   The OVSC Laboratory Test Procedures, prepared for the limited \\npurpose of use by independent laboratories under contract to conduct compliance tests for the OVSC, are not rules, regulations or NHTSA \\ninterpretations regarding the meani ng of a FMVSS.  The  Laboratory Test \\nProcedures are not intended to limit the requirements of the applicable \\nFMVSS(s).  In some cases, the OVSC Laboratory Test Procedures do not \\ninclude all of the various FMVSS mi nimum performance requirements.  \\nRecognizing applicable test toleran ces, the Laboratory Test Procedures \\nmay specify test conditions that  are less severe than the minimum \\nrequirements of the standard.  In addi tion, the Laboratory Test Procedures \\nmay be modified by the OVSC at an y time without noti ce, and the COTR \\nmay direct or authorize contractors to deviate from these procedures, as \\nlong as the tests are performed in a ma nner consistent with the standard \\nitself and within the scope of the c ontract.  Laboratory Test Procedures \\nmay not be relied upon to create any right or benefit in any person.  \\nTherefore, compliance of a vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment is \\nnot necessarily guaranteed if the manufact urer limits its certification tests \\nto those described in the OVSC Laboratory Test Procedures.  \\n  2 \\n2. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS  \\n \\nFederal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 108- Lamps, reflective \\ndevices, and associated equipment , herein referred to as “the Standard” or “this \\nStandard,” specifies requirem ents for original and replacement lamps, reflective \\ndevices, and associated equipment.  T he purpose of the standard is to reduce \\ntraffic accidents and deaths and injuries re sulting from traffic accidents, by \\nproviding adequate illuminati on of the roadway, and by enhancing the conspicuity \\nof motor vehicles on the public roads so that their presence is perceived and their \\nsignals understood, both in  daylight and in darkness or other conditions of \\nreduced visibility.  The standard applie s to passenger cars, multipurpose \\npassenger vehicles (MPVs), trucks, buses, tr ailers (except pole trailers and trailer \\nconverter dollies), and motorcycles, and to lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment for repl acement of like equipment on vehicles to which this \\nstandard applies. \\n \\nEach vehicle shall be equipped with at l east the number of lamps, reflective \\ndevices, and associated equipment specified in the Standard, and required equipment shall be designed to conform to the SAE Standards or Recommended Practices referenced in the Standard as applicable. \\n \\n3. SECURITY  \\n \\nThe contractor shall provide appropriate se curity measures to protect the OVSC \\ntest equipment from unauthor ized personnel during the entire compliance testing \\nprogram.  The contractor is financially re sponsible for any acts of theft and/or \\nvandalism which occur during the storage of test equipment.  Any security \\nproblems which arise shall be reported by  telephone to the Industrial Property \\nManager (IPM), Office of Contracts and Procurement, within two working days \\nafter the incident.  A letter containing specif ic details of the security problem will \\nbe sent to the IPM (with copy to the COTR ) within 48 hours.  T he contractor shall \\nprotect and segregate the data that evolve s from compliance testing before and \\nafter each test.  No information conc erning the safety compliance testing \\nprogram shall be released to anyone exc ept the COTR, unless specifically \\nauthorized by the COTR, t he COTR\\'s Branch or Division Chief, or by the \\nContracting Officer. \\n \\nNOTE:   NO INDIVIDUALS, OTHER THAN  CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL, \\nSHALL BE ALLOWED TO WITNESS ANY COMPLIANCE TEST UNLESS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED BY THE COTR.  \\n \\n4. GOOD HOUSEKEEPING  \\n \\nContractors shall maintain the entire equipment compliance testing area, test \\nfixtures and instrumentat ion in a neat and clean condit ion with test instruments \\narranged in an orderly manner  consistent with good test  laboratory housekeeping \\npractices. \\n  3 \\n5. TEST SCHEDULING AND MONITORING  \\n \\nThe contractor shall submit a test schedule to the COTR prior to testing.  Tests \\nshall be completed as required in the contract.  All test ing shall be coordinated to \\nallow monitoring by the COTR. \\n \\n6. TEST DATA DISPOSITION  \\n \\nThe contractor shall make all equipm ent preliminary compliance test data \\navailable to the COTR on loca tion within four hours after th e test.  Final test data, \\nincluding digital printouts and computer generated plots (if applicable), shall be \\nfurnished to the COTR in accordance with the contract schedule. \\n \\nAll backup data sheets, strip charts, reco rdings, plots, technicians notes, etc., \\nshall be retained by the contractor for a mi nimum of five years after conclusion of \\neach delivery order, purchase or der, etc.  The COTR shall direct final disposition \\nat that time. \\n \\n7. GOVERNMENT FURNISH ED PROPERTY (GFP)  \\n \\n EQUIPMENT MARKING, SECURITY AND STORAGE  \\nGovernment supplied test items must  be stored in a clean, dry and secure \\nstorage area to prevent deterioration of the samples in any manner which might \\naffect test results. \\n \\nAll test items shall be inspected and inv entoried within one week of receipt and \\ncopies of this inventory shall be fo rwarded to the OVSC within ten days of \\nequipment arrival. \\n \\nEach test item shall be identified and marked to prevent improper test \\nsequencing. The marking shall be permanently affixed to each sample in a manner which does not affect test results. \\n \\n8. CALIBRATION OF TEST INSTRUMENTS  \\n \\nBefore the contractor initiates the sa fety compliance test program, a test \\ninstrumentation calibration system  will be implemented and maintained in \\naccordance with established ca libration practices.  Gu idelines for setting up and \\nmaintaining such calibration system s are described in MIL-C-45662A, \\n\"Calibration System Requ irements\".  The calibration  system shall be set up and \\nmaintained as follows: \\n  A. Standards for calibrating the meas uring and test equipment will be stored \\nand used under appropriate environmental  conditions to assure their \\naccuracy and stability. \\n  B. All measuring instruments and standards shall be calibrated by the \\ncontractor, or a commercial facili ty, against a higher order standard at \\nperiodic intervals NOT TO EXCEED TW ELVE (12) MONTHS except for \\nstatic types of measuring devices such as rulers, weights, etc., which shall \\nbe calibrated at periodic intervals not  to exceed two years.  Records,  4 \\nshowing the calibration traceability to the National Institute of Standards \\nand Technology (NIST), shall be mainta ined for all measuring and test \\nequipment. \\n  C. All measuring and test equipment and measuring standards will be labeled \\nwith the following information: \\n   (1) Date of calibration    (2) Date of next scheduled calibration   D. A written calibration procedure s hall be provided by the contractor  \\n  which includes as a minimu m the following information for all \\nmeasurement and test equipment unless the calibration is performed by a \\nlicensed commercial facility. \\n   (1) Type of equipment, manuf acturer, model number, etc. \\n   (2) Measurement range    (3) Accuracy    (4) Calibration interval    (5) Type of standard used to calibrate the equipment (calibration \\ntraceability of the st andard must be evident) \\n \\n E. Records of calibration for all test  instrumentation shall be kept by the \\ncontractor in a manner which assu res the maintenance of established \\ncalibration schedules.  All such reco rds shall be readily available for \\ninspection when requested by the COTR.  The calibration system will \\nneed the acceptance of the COTR bef ore the test program commences. \\n \\n9. PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTATION  \\n \\nEach final test report shall include colo r images (minimum size 4 x 6 inches), with \\nminimum resolution of 150dpi.

The visibility shall be at  least 1,250 square millimeters for the \\nlens area method or emit 0.05 candela throughout the des ignated pattern.  If the \\ntest sample fails to meet the minimu m requirements for visibility, refer to \\nparagraph S6.4.4 of FMVSS No. 108 to determine if the sample can be tested in accordance with the legacy visibility alternative.  \\n12.1.1.8) INDICATOR \\n   \\nGENERAL \\n \\nEach vehicle equipped with a turn signal  operating unit where any turn signal \\nlamp is not visible to the driver must also have an illuminated pilot indicator to \\nprovide a clear and unmistakable indica tion that the turn signal system is \\nactivated.   The indicator must consist of one or mo re lights flashing at the same frequency \\nas the turn signal lamps.   The indicator must function satisfactorily under all test conditions imposed on the \\nturn signal flasher in S14.9 of FMVSS No. 108.  21 \\n \\nINDICATOR SIZE AND COLOR \\n \\nIf the indicator is located inside the vehi cle it should emit a green colored light \\nand have a minimum area equivalent to a 3/16 in. diameter circle.   \\n If the indicator is located outside of the vehicle it s hould emit a yellow light and \\nhave a minimum projected illumi nated area of 0.1 sq. in. \\n The minimum required illuminated area of the indicator must be visible to any \\ntangent on the 95th eyellipse as defined in SAE J941 (what revision?)  with the \\nsteering wheel turned to a straight ahead driving position and in the design \\nlocation for an adjustable wheel or column.  \\nTURN SIGNAL LAMP FAILURE \\n \\nFailure of one or more turn signal lamp s such that the minimum photometric \\nperformance specified in Tables VI or  VII of FMVSS No. 108 is not being met \\nmust be indicated by the turn signal pilot indicator by a “steady on”, “steady off”, \\nor by a significant change in the flashi ng rate., except when a variable-load turn \\nsignal flasher is used on a multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, or bus 2032 \\nmm. or more in overall width, on a truck that is capable of accommodating a slide \\nin camper, or on any vehicle equipped to tow trailers.  \\n12.1.1.9) MARKINGS \\n \\nEach lamp may be marked with the symbol “DOT” which constitutes a \\ncertification that it conforms to the requirements of this standard.   \\n \\n12.1.1.10) SPACING TO OTHER LAMPS \\n \\nEach front turn signal lamp  must also be designed to comply to any additional \\nphotometry requirements based on its inst alled spacing to other lamps as \\nspecified by in S7.1.1.10 of FMVSS No . 108.  Where more than one spacing \\nrelationship exists for a turn signal la mp the requirement must be the one that \\nspecifies the highest luminous intens ity multiplier of Table VI.   \\n \\nSpacing measurement for non- reflector la mps. For any front turn signal lamp \\nthat does not employ a reflector to m eet photometric require ments, the spacing \\nmust be measured from the li ght source of the turn signal lamp to the lighted \\nedge of any lower beam headlamp, or any la mp such as an auxiliary lower beam \\nheadlamp or fog lamp used to suppl ement the lower beam headlamp. \\n \\nSpacing measurement for lamp s with reflectors.  For any  front turn signal lamp \\nwhich employs a reflector, such as a par abolic reflector, to meet photometric \\nrequirements, the spacing must be measur ed from the geometric  centroid of the \\nturn signal lamp effective projected luminous  lens area to the lighted edge of any \\nlower beam headlamp, or any lamp such as  an auxiliary lower beam headlamp or \\nfog lamp used to supplement the lower beam headlamp.  \\n \\nSpacing based photometric multipliers.  Where the spacing measurement of \\nS7.1.1.10.2 or S7.1.1.10.3 of FMVSS No. 108 between a turn signal lamp and  22 \\nthe lighted edge of any lamp such as an auxiliary lower beam headlamp or fog \\nlamp used to supplement the lower beam  headlamp is at least 75 mm. but less \\nthan 100 mm. the photometric mu ltiplier of Table VI mu st be 1.5.; where the \\nspacing measurement is at least 60 mm.  but less than 75 mm. the photometric \\nmultiplier must be 2.0.; w here the spacing measurement  is less than 60 mm. the \\nphotometric multiplier must be 2.5.  Where the spacing measurement of \\nS7.1.1.10.2 or S7.1.1.10.3 of FMVSS No. 108 between a turn signal lamp and \\nthe lighted edge of any lower beam headlamp is less than 100 mm. the \\nphotometric multiplier must be 2.5. \\n \\n12.1.1.11) MULTIPLE COMPART MENTS AND MULTIPLE LAMPS \\n \\n See applicable requirements in S7.1.1.11 of FMVSS No. 108.  \\n12.1.1.12) RATIO \\n \\nWhen a parking lamp, or a clearance lamp  on a multipurpose passenger vehicle, \\ntruck, trailer, or bus of  2032 mm. or more in overa ll width, is combined with a \\nfront turn signal lamp, the luminous intensit y of the front turn signal lamp at each \\nidentified test point must not be less t han the luminous intensity of the parking \\nlamp or clearance lamp at that same test  point times the multiplier shown for that \\ntest point in Table VI of FMVSS No. 108.  \\n \\nIf a multiple compartment or multiple lamp arrangement is used on a passenger \\ncar or on a multipurpose pa ssenger vehicle, truck, bus , or trailer of less than \\n2032 mm. in overall width, and the distanc e between the optical axes for both the \\nparking lamp and turn signal lamp is within 560 mm. for two compartment or \\nlamp arrangements or 410 mm. for three compartment or la mp arrangements, \\nthen the ratio must be co mputed with all compartment s or lamps lighted.  \\n \\nIf a multiple compartment or multiple lamp arrangement is used and the distance \\nbetween optical axes for one of the functions exceeds 560 mm. for two \\ncompartment or lamp arr angements or 410 mm. for three compartments or lamp \\narrangements, then the rati o must be computed for onl y those compartments or \\nlamps where the parking lamp and turn signal lamp are optically combined.   Where the clearance lamp is combined with the turn signal lamp, and the \\nmaximum luminous intensity of the clear ance lamp is located below horizontal \\nand within an area generated by a 1.0º radius  around a test point, the ratio for the \\ntest point may be computed using the lo west value of the clearance lamp \\nluminous intensity withi n the generated area. \\n \\n12.1.1.13) PHOTOMETRY \\n \\nThe lamp shall be photometry tested as outlined in Appendix G for the number of \\nlamp compartments and the type of vehicle for which it is designed.

The visibility shall be at least 1,250 square millimeters for the lens \\narea method or emit 0.05 candela throughout  the designated pattern.  If the test \\nsample fails to meet the minimum requirem ents for visibility, re fer to paragraph S6.4.4 \\nto determine if the sample can be test ed in accordance with the legacy visibility \\nalternative.  \\n12.1.2.8) INDICATOR \\n   \\nGENERAL \\n \\nEach vehicle equipped with a turn signal ope rating unit where any turn signal lamp is \\nnot visible to the driver must also have an illuminated pilot indicato r to provide a clear \\nand unmistakable indication that the turn signal system is activated.  \\n The indicator must consist of one or more lights flashing at the same frequency as the \\nturn signal lamps.    47 \\nThe indicator must function satisfactorily und er all test conditions imposed on the turn \\nsignal flasher in S14.9 of FMVSS No. 108.  \\nINDICATOR SIZE AND COLOR \\n \\nIf the indicator is located inside the vehicl e it should emit a green colored light and \\nhave a minimum area equivalent to a 3/16 in. diameter circle.   \\n If the indicator is located out side of the vehicle it should emit a yellow light and have a \\nminimum projected illuminated area of 0.1 sq. in.  The minimum required illuminated area of the indicator must be visible to any tangent \\non the 95th eyellipse as defined in SAE J941 (what revision?)  with the steering wheel \\nturned to a straight ahead driving position an d in the design location for an adjustable \\nwheel or column.  \\nTURN SIGNAL LAMP FAILURE \\n \\nFailure of one or more turn signal la mps such that the minimum photometric \\nperformance specified in Tables VI or V II of FMVSS No. 108 is not being met must be \\nindicated by the turn signal pilot indicato r by a “steady on”, “steady off”, or by a \\nsignificant change in the flashi ng rate., except when a variabl e-load turn signal flasher \\nis used on a multipurpose passenger vehicl e, truck, or bus 2032 mm. or more in \\noverall width, on a truck that is capable of  accommodating a slide in camper, or on any \\nvehicle equipped to tow trailers. \\n \\n12.1.2.9) MARKINGS \\n \\nEach lamp may be marked with the symbol “DOT ” which constitutes a certification that \\nit conforms to the require ments of this standard.   \\n \\n12.1.2.10) SPACING TO OTHER LAMPS \\n \\nNo requirement. \\n \\n12.1.2.11) MULTIPLE COMPART MENTS AND MULTIPLE LAMPS \\n \\n See applicable requirements in S7.1.2.11 of FMVSS No. 108.  \\n12.1.2.12) RATIO \\n \\nWhen a taillamp, or a clearance lamp on a mu ltipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, \\ntrailer, or bus of 2032 mm. or more in over all width, is combined with a rear turn signal \\nlamp, the luminous intensity of the rear turn  signal lamp at each identified test point \\nmust not be less than the luminous intensity of the taillamp or clearance lamp at that \\nsame test point times the multiplier shown fo r that test point in Table VII of FMVSS No. \\n108.    48 \\nIf a multiple compartment or multiple la mp arrangement is used on a passenger car \\nor on a multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck,  bus, or trailer of less than 2032 mm. in \\noverall width, and the distanc e between the optical axes for both the taillamp and turn \\nsignal lamp is within 560 mm. for two com partment or lamp arr angement or 410 mm. \\nfor three compartments or lamp arrangement s, then the ratio mu st be computed with \\nall compartments or lamps lighted.    If a multiple compartment or multiple lamp arrangement is used and the distance \\nbetween optical axes for one of the functi ons exceeds 560 mm. fo r two compartment \\nor lamp arrangements or 410 mm. for three compartment or lamp arrangements, then \\nthe ratio must be computed for only those compartments or lamps where the taillamp \\nand turn signal lamp are optically combined.    Where the taillamp or clearance lamp is co mbined with the turn signal lamp, and the \\nmaximum luminous intensity of the taillamp  or clearance lamp is located below \\nhorizontal and within an area gener ated by a 0.5º radius around a test point for a \\ntaillamp on a passenger car or on a multipur pose passenger vehicle, truck, bus, or \\ntrailer of less than 2032 mm. in overall width, or by a 1.0º radius around a test point for \\na taillamp or clearance lamp on a vehicle 2032 mm. or more in overall width, the ratio \\nfor the test point may be com puted using the lowest value of  the taillamp or clearance \\nlamp luminous intensit y within the generated area. \\n \\n12.1.2.13) PHOTOMETRY \\n \\nThe lamp shall be photometry tested as out lined in Appendix G for the number of lamp \\ncompartments and the type of vehicle for which it is designed.   \\n   The photometer element shall be located at a distance of 100 f eet from the test device.  \\nA calibrated bulb(s) will be operated at rated mean spherica l candlepower.   \\n If the lamp is tested as part of a combinat ion lamp, the appropriate data sheet shall be \\ncompleted including minimum ratios as deter mined in the previous section (RATIO) of \\nthis procedure.

If the \\nperformance specified is not achievable, the requirements of S10.18.3.1 of FMVSS \\nNo. 108 apply, except that if  the aiming mechanism is not  a VHAD, the requirements \\nspecific to VHADs are not applicable, and the in struction must be specific to the aiming \\nmechanism installed.  Should the mechanism not meet the requi rements above, a caut ionary label must be \\nplaced adjacent to the mechanism stating th e caution and including either the reason \\nfor the caution or the corrective action necessa ry. Each such label must also refer the \\nreader to the vehicle operator’s manual for complete instructions. Each such vehicle \\nmust be equipped with an operator’s manual containing the complete instructions \\nappropriate for the me chanism installed. \\n  \\nHORIZONTAL ADJUSTMENT-VI SUALLY AIMED HEADLAMP \\n \\nA visually/optically aim able headlamp that has a lo wer beam must not have a \\nhorizontal adjustment mechanism unless such  mechanism meets the requirements of \\nthis standard for a VHAD.  \\nOPTICAL AXIS MARKING \\n OPTICAL AXIS MARKING-VEHICLE  \\n \\nEach motor vehicle must be equipped with headlamps or beam contributors which \\nhave a mark or markings that are visible from the front of t he headlamp when installed \\non the vehicle to identify the optical axis of the headlamp to assure proper horizontal \\nand vertical alignment of the aiming screen or optical aiming equipment.  The \\nmanufacturer is free to choose the design of  the mark or markings. The mark or \\nmarkings may be on the interior or  exterior of the lens or i ndicated by a mark or central   248\\n structure on the interior or  exterior of the headlamp. \\n \\nOPTICAL AXIS MARKING-LAMP \\n \\nEach headlamp or beam contributor that is no t visually/optically aimable in accordance \\nwith S10.18.9 of FMVSS No. 108 must be equipped with fiducial marks, aiming pads, \\nor similar references of sufficient det ail and accuracy, for determination of an \\nappropriate vehicle plane to be used with t he photometric procedures  of S14.2.5 of \\nFMVSS No. 108 for correct alignment with the photometer axis when being tested for \\nphotometric compliance, and to serve for the aiming reference when the headlamp or \\nbeam contributor is installed on a motor vehi cle.  The fiducial marks, aiming pads, or \\nsimilar references are protrusions, bubble vials, holes, indentations, ridges, scribed \\nlines, or other readily identif iable marks established and described by the vehicle or \\nheadlamp manufacturer.  \\nOPTICAL AXIS MARKING- VISUAL AIM HEADLAMP \\n \\nThere must be a mark or markings identifyi ng the optical axis of the headlamp visible \\nfrom the front of the headlamp when installed on the vehicle, to assure proper \\nhorizontal and vertical alignm ent of the aiming screen or opt ical aiming equipment with \\nthe headlamp being aimed. The manufacturer is  free to choose the design of the mark \\nor markings. The mark or markings may be on the interior or exteri or of the lens or \\nindicated by a mark or central structure on the interior or exterior of the headlamp. \\n \\nMOVEABLE REFLECTORS  \\n Each headlamp aimed by moving the refl ector relative to the lens and headlamp \\nhousing, or vice versa, must conform with th e photometric requirements applicable to it \\nwhen tested according to the procedure of S 14.2.5 of FMVSS No. 108 with the lens at \\nany position relative to the reflector within t he full range of vertical pitch on the vehicle \\non which the headlamp system is installed and a horizontal range of ± 2.5°.   \\nAdditionally it must comply with the ai ming adjustment require ments of S14.6 of \\nFMVSS No. 108.  \\nEXTERNAL AIMING \\n \\nEach headlamp system that is capable of be ing mechanically aimed by externally \\napplied headlamp aiming devices must be mechanically aimable using the equipment \\nspecified in SAE J602, Headlamp Aiming De vice for Mechanically Aimable Sealed \\nBeam Headlamp Units, October 1980, witho ut the removal of any ornamental trim \\nrings, covers, wipers or other vehicle parts. \\n \\nHEADLAMP AIMING DEVICE LOCATING PLATES \\n \\nEach headlamp system which is designed to use the Headlamp Aiming Device Locating Plates with adjus table legs for the 100x165 mm unit and the 142x200 mm \\nunit, and which has adjustable length legs, must meet the following requirements. \\n The lens must have three aiming pads whic h meet the requireme nts of  Figure 3, \\nDimensional Specifications for Location of Aiming Pads on Replaceable Bulb \\nHeadlamp Units. The aiming pads need not be c entered at the geomet ric center of the   249\\n lens, or on the optical axis.

The \\nheight of these numbers must be not le ss than .157 inch (4 mm). If there is \\ninterference between the plane and the area of the lens between the aiming pads, the \\nwhole number represents the distance to  a secondary plane.

If the most forward aiming pad is the lowe r inboard aiming pad, then the dimensions \\nmay be placed anywhere on the lens. The di mension for the outboard aiming pad \\n(Dimension F in Figure 3 of FMVSS No. 108) must be followed by the letter “H” and \\nthe dimension for the center aiming pad mu st be followed by the letter “V.” The \\ndimensions must be express ed in tenths of an inch. \\n \\nNONADJUSTABLE HEADLAMP AIMING DEVICE LOCATING PLATES \\n \\nEach headlamp may be designed to use the nonadjustable Headlamp Aiming Device \\nLocating Plate for the 100 x165 mm unit, the 142x200 mm  unit, the 146 mm diameter \\nunit, or the 178 mm diameter unit of SAE J602, or the 92x150 mm Type F unit, and \\nincorporate lens-mounted aiming pads as spec ified for those units in Appendix C of \\npart 564 of this chapter. If so designed, no additional lens marking is necessary to \\ndesignate the type of plate or dimensions. \\n \\nON-VEHICLE AIMING \\n \\nEach headlamp system that is capable of being aimed by equipment installed on the vehicle \\nmust include a Vehicle Headlamp Aiming Device  (VHAD) that confor ms to the following \\nrequirements:  \\nAIM \\n \\nThe VHAD must provide for headlamp aim inspection and adjustment in both the \\nvertical and horizontal axes.  \\nVERTICAL AIM \\n \\nThe VHAD must include the necessary referenc es and scales relative to the horizontal \\nplane to assure correct vertical aim for photometry and aiming purposes. An off vehicle \\nmeasurement of the angle of t he plane of the ground is permitted. In addition, an equal \\nnumber of graduations from t he ‘‘O’’ position representing angular changes in the axis \\nin the upward and downward directions must be provided. \\n \\nEach graduation must repres ent a change in the vertical position of the mechanical \\naxis not larger than 0.19° (1 in. at 25 ft.) to  provide for variations in aim at least 1.2° \\nabove and below the horizontal, and have an accura cy relative to the zero mark of less \\nthan 0.1°.  The VHAD must be marked to indicate headlamp aim movement  in the upward and \\ndownward directions.    250\\n Each graduation must indicate a linear move ment of the scale indicator of not less \\nthan 0.05 in. (1.27 mm) if a direct reading analog  indicator is used.  If a remote reading \\nindicator is provided, it must represent the actual aim movement in a clear, \\nunderstandable format.  The vertical indicator must perform  through a minimum range of ±1.2°. \\n Means must be provided in the VHAD for co mpensating for deviations in floor slope \\nless than 1.2° from the horizontal that w ould affect the correct positioning of the \\nheadlamp for vertical aim.  The graduations must be legible under an illu mination level not greater than 30 foot \\ncandles, measured at the top of the graduation, by an obs erver having 20/20 vision \\n(Snellen), and must permit ai m adjustment to within 0. 19° (1 in. at 25 ft.). \\n \\nHORIZONTAL AIM \\n \\nThe VHAD must include references and scales re lative to the longitudinal axis of the \\nvehicle necessary to assure correct hor izontal aim for photometry and aiming \\npurposes. An ‘‘O’’ mark must be used to indi cate alignment of the headlamps relative \\nto the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. In  addition, an equal number of graduations from \\nthe ‘‘O’’ position representing eq ual angular changes in the axis relative to the vehicle \\naxis must be provided.  Each graduation must repres ent a change in the horizontal position of the mechanical \\naxis not greater than 0.38° (2 in . at 25 ft.) to provide for vari ations in aim at least 0.76° \\n(4in. at 25 ft.) to the left and right of the longitudinal axis  of the vehicle, and must have \\nan accuracy relative to the ze ro mark of less than 0.1°. \\n The VHAD must be marked to indicate headl amp aim movement in the left and right \\ndirections.  The graduations must be legible under an illumi nation level not greater than 30 foot \\ncandles, measured at the top of the graduation, by an obs erver having 20/20 vision \\n(Snellen), and must permit ai m adjustment to within 0. 38° (2 in. at 25 ft.). \\n The horizontal indicator must perform through a minimum range of ±0.76° (4 in. at 25 \\nft.); however, the indicator it self must be capable of recalib ration over a movement of \\n±2.5° relative to the longit udinal axis of the vehicle to accommodate any adjustment \\nnecessary for recalibrating the indicator a fter vehicle repair fr om accident damage. \\n \\nAIMING INSTRUCTIONS \\n \\nThe instructions for properly aiming the head lighting system usi ng the VHAD must be \\nprovided on a label permanently affixed to t he vehicle adjacent to the VHAD, or in the \\nvehicle operator’s manual. The instructions must advise that the headlighting system is \\nproperly aimed if the appr opriate vertical plane (as defined by the vehicle \\nmanufacturer) is perpendicular to both the longitudinal ax is of the vehicle, and a \\nhorizontal plane when t he vehicle is on a horizontal surfac e, and the VHAD is set at “0” \\nvertical and “0” horizontal.  Should a remote indicato r or a remote indicator and adjuster be provided, the   251\\n instructions must be placed in the operat or’s manual, and may also be placed on a \\nlabel adjacent to the VHAD.  \\nPERMANENT CALIBRATION \\n \\nEach headlamp equipped with a VHAD must  be manufactured with its calibration \\npermanently fixed by its manufacturer. Calibra tion in this case means the process of \\naccurately aligning the geometry of the VH AD devices with the beam pattern for the \\npurposes of compliance with the standard. \\n \\nREPLACEMENT UNITS \\n \\nWhen tested according to the procedure of S14.2.5 of FMVSS No. 108 with any \\nreplacement headlamp unit(s) or light s ources intended for use in the system under \\ntest, the VHAD and headlamp sy stem must be designed to c onform to the photometric \\nperformance requirements appropriate  for the system under test. \\n \\nPHYSICAL TESTS \\n \\nEach VHAD must be designed to conform wit h the performance requ irements of S14.8 \\nof FMVSS No. 108.  \\nVISUAL/OPTICAL AIMING \\n \\nEach visually/optically aimable headlamp mu st be designed to conf orm to the following \\nrequirements: \\n \\nVERTICAL AIM, LOWER BEAM \\n \\nEach lower beam headlamp must have a cutoff  in the beam pattern. It may be either \\non the left side or the right si de of the optical axis, but once chosen for a particular \\nheadlamp system’s design, the side chosen for the cutoff must not be changed for any \\nheadlamps intended to be used as replac ements for those system’s headlamps. \\n \\nVERTICAL POSITION OF THE CUTOFF \\n \\nThe headlamp must be aimed vertically so that  the cutoff is on t he left side, at 0.4° \\ndown from the H–H line,  or on the right side,  at the H–H line. \\n \\nVERTICAL GRADIENT \\n \\nThe gradient of the cutoff measured at either  2.5° L or 2.0° R must be not less than \\n0.13 based on the procedure of S10.18.9.1.5 of FMVSS No. 108. \\n \\nHORIZONTAL POSITION OF THE CUTOFF \\n \\nThe width must be not less than 2°, with not less than 2° of its actual width centered at \\neither 2.5° L, or 2.0° R. \\n \\nMAXIMUM INCLINATION OF THE  CUTOFF \\n \\nThe vertical location of the highest gradient at the ends of the minimum width must be   252\\n within ±0.2° of the vertical location of the maximum gradi ent measured at the \\nappropriate vertical line (at eit her 2.5° L for a left side cutoff , or 2.0° R for a right side \\ncutoff.) \\n \\nMEASURING THE CUTOFF PARAMETER \\n \\nThe headlamp is mounted on a fixture which simulates its actual design location on \\nany vehicle for which the headlamp is in tended. The fixture, with the headlamp \\ninstalled is attached to the goniometer table in such a wa y that the fixture alignment \\naxes are coincident with the goniometer axes. The headlamp is energized at the \\nspecified test voltage.  The cutoff parameter must be measur ed at a distance of 10 m. \\nfrom a photosensor wit h a 10 mm. diameter. \\n \\nThe headlamp beam pattern is aimed with the cutoff at the H-H axis. There is no \\nadjustment, shimming, or modification of the horizontal axis of t he headlamp or test \\nfixture, unless the headlamp is  equipped with a VHAD. In this case the VHAD is \\nadjusted to zero.  A vertical scan of the beam pattern is conducted for a headlamp with a left side \\ngradient by aligning the goniometer on a vertic al line at 2.5° L and scanning from 1.5° \\nU to 1.5° D. For a headlamp with a right si de gradient, a vertical scan of the beam \\npattern is conducted by aligning the goniom eter on a vertical line at 2.0° R and \\nscanning from 1.5° U to 1.5° D.  Determine the maximum gradient within the r ange of the scan by using the formula: G \\n= log E(a)-logE(a+0.1), where “G” is the gradi ent, “E” is illumination and “a” is vertical \\nangular position. The maximum value of t he gradient “G” determi nes the vertical \\nangular location of the cutoff. Perform ve rtical scans at 1.0° L and R of the \\nmeasurement point of the maximum gr adient to determine the inclination. \\n \\nHORIZONTAL AIM,  LOWER BEAM \\n \\nThere is no adjustment of horizontal ai m unless the headlamp is equipped with a \\nhorizontal VHAD. If the headlamp has  a VHAD, it is set to zero. \\n \\nVERTICAL AIM, UPPER BEAM \\n \\nIf the upper beam is combined in a headlamp with a lower beam, the vertical aim of \\nthe upper beam must not be changed from the aim set us ing the procedures of \\nS10.18.9.1 and S10.18.9.2 of FMVSS No. 108 used for the lower beam.  If the upper beam is not combined in a headla mp with a lower beam, the vertical aim \\nof the upper beam is adjusted so that the ma ximum beam intensity is located on the H-\\nH axis. \\n \\nHORIZONTAL AIM, UPPER BEAM \\n \\nIf the upper beam is combined in a headlamp with a lower beam, the horizontal aim of \\nthe upper beam is not be change d from the aim set using the procedures of S14.9.1 \\nand S10.18.9.2 of FMVSS No. 108 used for the lower beam.  If the upper beam is not combined in a head lamp with the lower beam and has fixed   253\\n horizontal aim or has a horizontal VHAD , then the headlamp is mounted on a fixture \\nwhich simulates its actual design location on any vehicle for which the headlamp is intended. The fixture, with t he headlamp installed, is atta ched to the goniometer table \\nin such a way that the fixt ure alignment axes are coinci dent with the goniometer axes. \\nThe headlamp must be energized at 12.8 ± 0.20 mV. There is no adjustment, \\nshimming, or modification of the horizontal axis of the headlamp or te st fixture, unless \\nthe headlamp is equipped with a VHAD. In this  case the VHAD is adjusted to zero. \\n If the upper beam is not combined in a headla mp with a lower beam, and it does not \\nhave a VHAD, the horizontal aim of the upper  beam is adjusted so that the maximum \\nbeam intensity is located on the V-V axis. \\n \\nPHOTOMETRY \\n \\nA visually/optically aimable headlamp must be designed to conform to the lower beam \\nrequirements of columns LB1V, LB2V, LB3V, or LB4V of Table XIX of FMVSS No. 108 \\nwhen tested according to the procedur e of S14.2.5 of FMVSS No. 108. \\n \\nVISUAL/OPTICAL IDENTI FICATION MARKING \\n \\nEach letter used in marking according to  this paragraph must be not less than 3 mm. \\nhigh.   The lens of a lower beam headlamp must  be marked “VOL” if the headlamp is \\nintended to be visually/optically  aimed using the left side of  the lower beam pattern.  \\nThe lens of a lower beam headlamp must be marked “VOR” if the headlamp is \\nintended to be visually/optically  aimed using the right side of the lower beam pattern.  \\nThe lens of a headlamp that is solely  an upper beam headlamp and intended to be \\nvisually/optically aimed using the upper beam must be marked “VO”. \\n The lens of each sealed beam or integr al beam headlamp must be marked “VOR” if \\nthe headlamp is of a type t hat was manufactured before May 1, 1997, and if such \\nheadlamp type has been redesigned since then to  be visually/optically aimable.   254\\n  \\n12.29)  REPLACEABLE LIGHT SOURCES TEST PROCEDURE \\n \\nEach replaceable light source must be des igned to conform to the dimensions \\nand electrical specifications furnished wit h respect to it pursuant to part 564 of \\nthis chapter, and must conform to the following requirements: \\n \\n12.29.1) MARKINGS \\n \\nThe light source must be marked with t he bulb marking designation specified for \\nit in compliance with Appendix A or A ppendix B of part 564 of  this chapter.  \\n \\nEach replaceable light source must be marked with the symbol DOT and with a \\nname or trademark in accordance with S6.5 of FMVSS No. 108. \\n \\nIf a ballast is required for operation,  each ballast must bear the following \\npermanent markings: \\n \\n(a) Name or logo of ballast manufacturer; (b) Ballast part number or  unique identification; \\n(c) Part number or other unique identific ation of the light source for which \\nthe ballast is designed; (d) Rated laboratory life of  the light source/ballast  combination, if the \\ninformation for the light source has been filed in Appendix B of part 564 \\nof this chapter; (e) A warning that ballast output volt age presents the potential for severe \\nelectrical shock that could lead to permanent injury or death; \\n(f) Ballast output power in watts a nd output voltage in rms volts AC or \\nDC; and (g) The symbol ‘DOT’.  \\n \\n12.29.2) GAS DISCHARG E LABORATORY LIFE \\n \\nFor light sources that use excited gas mixt ures as a filament or discharge arc, \\nthe ‘‘rated laboratory life ’’ is determined in accordance with sections 4.3 and \\n4.9 of SAE Recommended Practice J2009 FEB93, Forward Discharge Lighting \\nSystems. \\n \\n12.29.3) PHYSICAL TESTS \\n \\nDEFLECTION TEST PROCEDURE \\n \\nWith the sample light source rigidly m ounted in a fixture in  a manner indicated \\nin Figure 8 of FMVSS No. 108, a force of  4.0±0.1 pounds (17.8±0.4N) is applied \\nat a distance “A” from the reference plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the glass capsule and parallel to the smallest dimension of the pressed glass \\ncapsule seal.  \\n \\nThe force is applied (using a rod with a hard rubber tip with a minimum spherical radius of .039 in [1 mm]) radia lly to the surface of the glass capsule in \\nfour locations in a plane parallel to  the reference plane and spaced at a \\ndistance “A” from that plane.    These force applications are spaced 90º apart   255\\n starting at the point per pendicular to the smallest dimension of the pressed \\nseal of the glass capsule.  \\n \\nThe bulb deflection is measured at the glass capsule surface at 180º opposite \\nto the force application.  Distance “A” fo r a replaceable light source other than \\nan HB Type is the dimension provided in accordance with Appendix A of part 564 of this chapter, section I.A.1 if the light source has a lower beam filament, \\nor as specified in section I.B.1 if the light source has only an upper beam filament. \\n \\nAfter completion of the deflection tes t, a sample light source must have no \\npermanent deflection of the glass envelo pe exceeding 0.13 mm in the direction \\nof applied force. \\n \\nPRESSURE TEST FOR REPLACEABLE LIGHT SOURCES \\n \\nThe capsule, lead wires and/or terminal s, and seal on each sample Type HB1, \\nType HB3, Type HB4, and Type HB5 light source, and on any other replaceable \\nlight source which uses a seal, is instal led in a pressure chamber as shown in \\nFigure 10 of FMVSS No. 108 so as to provide an airtight seal.   The diameter of \\nthe aperture in Figure 10 FMVSS No. 108 on a replaceable light source must be \\nthat dimension furnished for such light source in compliance with Appendix A or \\nAppendix B of part 564 of  this chapter.    \\n \\nThe light source is immersed in wate r for one minute while inserted in a \\ncylindrical aperture specified for the light source, and subjected to an air \\npressure of 70KPa (10 psig ) on the glass capsule side.   \\n \\nAfter completion of the pressure test, t he sample light source with an airtight \\nseal on the low pressure (connector side) must show no evidence of air bubbles on that side. \\n \\n12.29.4) POWER AND FLUX MEASUREMENT \\n \\nReplaceable light sources must be des igned to conform with the requirements \\nof section VII of Appendix A of part 564 of this chapter, or section IV of \\nAppendix B of part 564 of this chapter, for maximu m power and luminous flux \\nwhen tested using the following procedure: \\n \\nSEASONING \\n \\nThe filament or dischar ge arc is seasoned before m easurement of either \\nmaximum power or luminous flux. \\n \\nRESISTIVE FILAMENT SOURCE  \\n \\nSeason the light source at design voltage for 1% of its average design \\nlife or 10 hours, whichever is less,  before measurem ent of either \\nmaximum power or luminous flux. \\n   256\\n DISCHARGE SOURCE  \\n \\nFor a light source using excited gas mixtures as a filament or discharge \\narc, seasoning of the light source syst em, including any ballast required \\nfor its operation, is made in a ccordance with section 4.0 of SAE \\nRecommended Practice J2009 FEB93, Discharge Forward Lighting \\nSystems. \\n \\nTEST VOLTAGE  \\n \\nMeasurements are made with a direct cu rrent test voltage of 12.8V regulated \\nwithin one quarter of one percent.  \\nLUMINOUS FLUX MEASUREMENT \\n \\nThe measurement of luminous flux is m ade in accordance with the Illuminating \\nEngineering Society of No rth America, LM 45; IES Approved Method for \\nElectrical and Photometric Measurem ents of General Service Incandescent  \\nFilament Lamps (April 1980).  \\n \\nRESISTIVE FILAMENT LIGHT SOURCE SETUP \\n \\nLuminous flux measurements are made with the black cap installed on \\nType HB1, Type HB2, Type HB4, and Type HB5, and on any other replaceable light source so designed;  and is with the electrical conductor \\nand light source base shrouded with an opaque white cover, except for \\nthe portion normally located within the interior of t he lamp housing.   The \\nmeasurement of luminous flux for the Types HB3 and HB4 is made with \\nthe base covered with a white cover as shown in the drawings for Types HB3 and HB4 filed in Docket No. NHTSA 98–3397.   The white covers are used to eliminate the likelihood of  incorrect lumen measurement that \\nwill occur should the reflectance of the light source base and electrical \\nconnector be low.    \\nDISCHARGE LIGHT SOURCE SETUP \\n \\nWith the test voltage applied to the ballast input terminals, the \\nmeasurement of luminous flux is made with the black cap installed, if so \\ndesigned, and  is made with an opaque white colo red cover, except for \\nthe portion normally located within t he interior of the lamp housing.   257\\n 12.29.5) REPLACEABLE LIGHT SOURCE DATA SHEET SAMPLES  \\n \\n  See test report samples.    258\\n 12.30)  HEADLAMP CONCEALMENT  DEVICES TEST PROCEDURE \\n \\nWhile the headlamp is illumi nated, its fully opened headlamp concealment device must \\nremain fully opened should any loss of power to or within the headlamp concealment \\ndevice occur. \\n \\nWhenever any malfunction occurs in a component  that controls or conducts power for \\nthe actuation of the concealment device,  each closed headlamp concealment device \\nmust be capable of being fully opened by a m eans not requiring the use of any tools. \\nThereafter, the headlamp concealment device must remain fully opened until \\nintentionally closed. \\n \\nExcept for malfunctions covered by  S12.2 of FMVSS No. 108, each headlamp \\nconcealment device must be capable of  being fully opened and the headlamps \\nilluminated by actuation of a single switch, lever, or similar mechanism, including a \\nmechanism that is automatically actuat ed by a change in ambient light conditions. \\n \\nEach headlamp concealment device must be  installed so that the headlamp may be \\nmounted, aimed, and adjusted without removing any component  of the device, other \\nthan components of the headlamp assembly. \\n \\nExcept for cases of malfunction covered by S12.2 of FMVSS No. 108, each headlamp \\nconcealment device must, within an ambient tem perature range of     -20° F to +120° \\nF, be capable of being fully opened in not more  than 3 seconds after the actuation of a \\ndriver-operated control.  \\n \\nAs an alternative to complying with the r equirements of S12.1 th rough S12.5, a vehicle \\nwith headlamps incorporating VH AD or visual/optical aiming in accordance with this \\nstandard may meet the requirements for Conc ealable lamps in paragraph 5.14 of the \\nfollowing version of the Economic Commi ssion for Europe Regulation 48 ‘‘Uniform \\nProvisions Concerning the A pproval of Vehicles With R egard to the Installation of \\nLighting and Light-Signal ing Devices’’: E/ECE/ 324–E/ECE/ TRANS/505, \\nRev.1/Add.47/Rev.1/Corr.2,  26 February 1996 (page 17), in the English language \\nversion.

The observation angle is the angle formed by a line from the observation point to the center of the reflector and a second line \\nfrom the center of t he reflector to the source of illumination.  \\n The entrance angle is the angle be tween the axis of the reflex \\nreflector and a line from the center of the reflector to the source of \\nillumination.    The entrance angle is designated left, right, up, and down in accordance with the position of t he source of illumination with \\nrespect to the axis of the reflex reflector as viewed from behind the \\nreflector.      676 \\nMeasurements are made of the lumi nous intensity which the reflex \\nreflector is projecting toward the observation point and the \\nillumination on the reflex reflector fr om the source of illumination.   \\n \\nMeasurements    \\n \\nReflex reflectors.    The required measurement for reflex \\nreflectors at each test point as shown in Table XVI of FMVSS No. 108 is the quotient of the projected luminous \\nintensity divided by the illumination expressed as \\nmillicandela per lux or candela per footcandle.   Retroreflective sheeting.  The required measurement for \\nretroreflective sheeting reflectors  at each test point as shown \\nin Table XVI of FMVSS No. 108 is candela per lux per square meter of area.  \\nReflex reflector photometry measurement adjustments    \\n \\nReflex reflectors, which do not have a fixed rotational position on the vehicle, are ro tated about their axis through \\n360º to find the minimum photometric value which must be reported for each test point.  If the output falls below the \\nminimum requirement at any te st point, the reflector is \\nrotated ± 5º about its axis fr om the angle where the minimum \\noutput occurred, and the maximum value within this angle is \\nreported as a tolerance value.   \\n Reflex reflectors, which by their design or construction, \\npermit mounting on a vehicle in a fixed rotational position, \\nare tested in this position.  A vi sual locator, such as the word \\nTOP is not considered adequate to establish a fixed \\nrotational position on the vehicle.   If uncolored reflections from t he front surface interfere with \\nphotometric readings at any te st point, additional readings \\nare taken 1º above, below, right, and left of the test point, and the lowest of these readings  and its location is reported \\nprovided the minimum test point  requirement for the test \\npoint is met. \\n \\nDaytime running lamp (DRL) photometry measurements  \\n \\nEach DRL is tested to the pr ocedure of “headlamp photometry \\nmeasurements” below, when a test volt age of 12.8 v.± 20 mV. is applied \\nto the input terminals of the lamp  switch module or voltage-reducing \\nequipment, whichever is closer to the el ectrical source on the vehicle.  \\n The test distance from the lamp to t he photometer is not less than 18.3 m. \\nif the lamp is optically combined wit h a headlamp, or is a separate lamp, \\nand not less than 3 m. if the lamp is optically combined with a lamp, other than a headlamp, that is r equired by this standard.    677 \\n \\nBulb requirements of S14.2.1.6 apply to DRL photometry. \\n \\nHEADLAMP PHOTOMETRY MEASUREMENTS  \\n \\nMounting.

A headlamp is tested at 12.8 \\nV ±20 mV, D.C. as measured at the terminals of the lamp. \\n Aiming. Each headlamp is aimed prior to a photometry test in accordance \\nwith the procedure appropriate to its aiming system.  A ¼ ° reaim is \\npermitted in any direction at any test  point to allow for variations in \\nreadings between laboratories for a ll headlamps except a Type F upper \\nbeam unit not equipped with a VHAD.  \\nMechanically aimable headlamps us ing an external aimer.

The lamp is wiped within 5 \\nseconds after removal of the cloth from the test fluid. A new lamp sample may \\nbe used with each fluid.  \\nTEST DURATION \\n \\nAfter the headlamp sample has been wiped wit h the test fluid, it must be stored \\nin its designed operating attitude for 48 hour s at a temperature of 23ºC±4ºC and \\na relative humidity of 30% ± 10%.  At  the end of the 48- hour period, the \\nheadlamp is wiped clean with a soft dry co tton cloth and visually inspected. \\n    714 \\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS \\n \\nAfter completion of the chemical resi stance test, the sample headlamp must \\nhave no surface deterioration, coating delam ination, fractures, deterioration of \\nbonding or sealing materials, color bl eeding, or color pickup visible without \\nmagnification and the headlamp must meet the requirements of  the appropriate \\nphotometry tests of Table XIX and Tabl e XVIII of FMVSS No. 108.  A ¼º reaim \\nis permitted in any direction at any test point. \\n \\nCORROSION TEST  \\nPROCEDURE  \\n \\nA sample headlamp, mounted on a headlamp te st fixture in designed operating \\nposition and including a ll accessory equipment necessary to operate in its \\nnormal manner, is subjected to a salt spray (fog) test in accordance with \\nASTMB117-73, Method of Salt Spray (Fog) Testing, for 50 total hours, \\nconsisting of two periods of 24 hours exposure followed by a 1 hour drying \\nperiod.  If a portion of the device is comp letely protected in service, that portion \\nis covered to prevent salt fog entry duri ng exposure. After removal from the salt \\nspray and the final 1 hour drying period the sample headlamp is examined for \\ncorrosion that affect any other applicable tests contained in Appendix J.  If such \\ncorrosion is found, the affected test(s ) must be performed on the corrosion \\nsample and the results recorded.  \\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS \\n \\nAfter completion of the corrosion test, the sample headlamp must not have any \\nobserved corrosion which would result in  the failure of any other applicable \\ntests contained in Appendix J and no co rrosion of the headlamp mounting and \\naiming mechanism that would result in  the failure of the aiming adjustment \\ntests, inward force test, or to rque deflection test  of Appendix J. \\n \\nCORROSION-CONNECTOR TEST  \\n \\nPROCEDURE  \\nA headlamp connector test must be perform ed on each filament circuit of the \\nsample headlamp prior to the test in S14.6.4.1.2 of FMVSS No. 108 according \\nto Figure 4 and S14.6.15 of FMVSS No. 108 .  The power source is set to \\nprovide 12. 8 volts and the resistance  must be set to produce 10 amperes. \\n The headlamp with connector attached to the terminals, unfixtured and in its \\ndesigned operating attitude with all drain holes, br eathing devices or other \\ndesigned openings in their normal operati ng positions, is subjected to a salt \\nspray (fog) test in accordance with ASTM B117-73, Method of Salt Spray (Fog) \\nTesting, for 240 hours, consisting of ten successive 24-hour periods.  \\n    715 \\nDuring each period, the headlamp is mounted in the middle of the chamber and \\nexposed for 23 hours to the salt spray. The spray is not activated during the \\n24th hour.  The bulb is removed from the headlamp and from the test chamber \\nduring the one hour of salt spray deactivati on and reinserted for the start of the \\nnext test period, at the end of the first and last three 23-hour periods of salt \\nspray exposure, and at the end of any tw o of the fourth through seventh 23-\\nhour periods of salt-spray exposure.   The test chamber is closed at all time s except for a maximum of 2 minutes \\nwhich is allowed for removal or replac ement of a bulb during each period.  \\n After the ten periods, the lens reflector unit without the bulb must be immersed \\nin deionized water for 5 minutes, then se cured and allowed to dry by natural \\nconvection only.  Using the voltage, resistance and pretes t set up of S14.6.4.1.1 of FMVSS No. \\n108 the current in each filament circ uit must be measured after the test \\nconducted in S14.6.4. 1.2 of FMVSS No. 108. \\n \\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS \\n \\nAfter the completion of the corrosion-c onnector test, the sample headlamp must \\nshow no evidence of external or inter nal corrosion or rust visible without \\nmagnification.   Loss of adhesion of any applied coating mu st not occur more than 3.2 mm from \\nany sharp edge on the inside or out.   \\n Corrosion may occur on terminals only if the test current produced during the \\ntest of S14.6.4.1.6 of FMVSS No . 108 is not less than 9.7 amperes. \\n \\nDUST TEST  \\nPROCEDURE \\nA sample headlamp, mounted on a headlamp te st fixture, with all drain holes, \\nbreathing devices or other design ed openings in their normal operating \\npositions, is positioned within a cubica l box, with inside measurements of 900 \\nmm. on each side or larger if required for adequate wall clearance (i.e., a distance of at least 150 mm between the headlamp and any wall of the box).  \\n The box contains 4.5 kg. of fine powder ed cement which conforms to the ASTM \\nC150-77 specification for Portland Cem ent. Every 15 minutes, the cement is \\nagitated by compressed air or  fan blower(s) by projecting blasts of air for a two-\\nsecond period in a downward direction so that the cement is diffused as uniformly as possible throughout the entire box.   This test is continued for five hours afte r which the exterior surfaces of the \\nheadlamp are wiped clean.     716 \\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS    \\n \\nAfter completion of the dust test, the sample headlamp must meet the \\nrequirements of the appropriate photometry  tests of Table XIX and Table XVIII \\nof FMVSS No. 108.  A ¼º reaim is permitted in any direction at any test point. \\n \\nTEMPERATURE CYCLE TEST AND INTERNAL HEAT TEST \\n \\nSAMPLES   \\n \\nA sample headlamp with one or mo re replaceable light sources is tested according to the procedures of this sect ion for a temperature cycle test and an \\ninternal heat test.  The same sample  headlamp is used in the temperature cycle \\ntest and then in the internal heat test.    \\nGENERAL PROCEDURE    \\n \\nTests are made with all fila ments lighted at design volt age that are intended to \\nbe used simultaneously in the headlamp a nd which in combination draw the \\nhighest total wattage. These include but are not limited to filaments used for \\nturn signal lamps, fog lamps, parking lamps, and headlamp lower beams lighted \\nwith upper beams when the wiring harness is so connected on the vehicle. \\n If a turn signal is included in the headlamp assembly, it is operated at 90 \\nflashes a minute with a 75%±2 % current ``on time.\\'\\'  \\n \\nIf the lamp produces both the upper and lower beam, it is tested in both the \\nupper beam mode and the lower beam mo de under the conditions above \\ndescribed, except for a headlamp with a single HB1 or HB2 replaceable light \\nsource.  \\n \\nTEMPERATURE CYCLE TEST \\n \\nPROCEDURE  \\nA sample headlamp, mounted on a headlamp test fixture, is subjected to \\n10 complete consecutive cycles having the thermal cycle profile shown in Figure 6 of FMVSS No. 108.  During the hot cycle, the lamp, is ener gized commencing at point ``A\\'\\' of \\nFigure 6 of FMVSS No. 108 and de- energized at point ``B.\\'\\'  \\n Separate or single test chamber s may be used to generate the \\nenvironment of Figure 6 of FMVSS No. 108. \\n \\nAll drain holes, breathi ng devices or other openi ngs or vents of the \\nheadlamps are set in their normal operating positions. \\n    717 \\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS \\n \\nAfter completion of the temperatur e cycle test, the sample headlamp \\nmust; \\n \\n(a) show no evidence of delamination,  fractures, entry  of moisture, \\nor deterioration of bonding material, color bleeding, warp or deformation visible without magnification \\n \\n(b) show no lens warpage gr eater than 3 mm when measured \\nparallel to the optical axis at the point of intersection of the axis \\nof each light source with the ex terior surface of the lens. \\n \\n(c) meet the requirem ents of the appropriate photometry tests of \\nTable XIX and Table XVIII of FMVSS No. 108.  A ¼º reaim is permitted in any direction at any test point. \\n \\nINTERNAL HEAT TEST  \\n \\nPROCEDURE  \\nA sample headlamp lens surface that would normally be exposed to road \\ndirt is uniformly sprayed with any appr opriate mixture of dust and water \\nor other materials to reduce the photom etric output at th e H-V test point \\nof the upper beam (or the ½D-1½R te st point of the lower beam as \\nappropriate) to 25%±2% of the output  originally measured in the \\nappropriate photometric compliance test.   \\n A headlamp with a single HB1 or HB2 r eplaceable light source is tested \\non the upper beam only.   Such reduction is determined under the same conditions as that of the original photometric measurement.  After the photometric out put of the lamp has been reduced as specified \\nabove, the sample lamp and its mounting hardware must be mounted in an environmental chamber in  a manner similar to that  indicated in Figure \\n7``Dirt/Ambient Test Setup.\\'\\'   The headlamp is soaked for one hour at a temperature of 35º + 4° -0º C) \\nand then the lamp is energized accordi ng to the procedure of this section \\nfor one hour in a still air condition, allo wing the temperature to rise from \\nthe soak temperature.  \\n \\nAt the end of one hour the sample lamp  is returned to a room ambient \\ntemperature of 23° + 4° -0º C and a relative humidity of 30%±10% and \\nallowed to stabilize to the room ambi ent temperature. The lens is then \\ncleaned. \\n    718 \\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS    \\n \\nAfter completion of the temperature cycl e test and meeting its requirements, \\nand completion of the internal heat  test, the sample headlamp must; \\n \\n(a) have no lens warpage greater t han 3 mm when measured parallel to \\nthe optical axis at the point of in tersection of the axis of each light \\nsource with the exterior surface of the lens. \\n (b) meet the requirements of the appr opriate photometry tests of Table \\nXIX and Table XVIII of FMVSS No. 108.  A ¼º reaim is permitted in any direction at any test point. \\n \\nHUMIDITY TEST \\n \\nPROCEDURE  \\nThe test fixture consists of a horizontal  steel plate to which three threaded steel \\nor aluminum rods of ½ inch diamet er are screwed vertically behind the \\nheadlamp. \\n \\nThe sample headlamp assembly is clamped to the vertical rods, which are behind the headlamp. All attachments to the headlamp assembly are made \\nbehind the lens and vents or openings, and ar e not within 2 inches laterally of a \\nvent inlet or outlet. \\n \\nThe mounted headlamp assembly is orient ed in its design operating position, \\nand is placed in a controlled environment  at a temperature of 100°+7°-0º F \\n(38º+4º-0° C) with a relative humidit y of not less than 90%. All drain holes, \\nbreathing devices, and other openings are set in their normal operation \\npositions for all phases of the humidity test.  \\n \\nThe headlamp is subjected to 24 consecut ive 3-hour test cycles. In each cycle, \\nthe headlamp is energized for 1 hour at design voltage with the highest \\ncombination of filament wattages t hat are intended to be used, and then de-\\nenergized for 2 hours. If the headlamp incorporates a turn signal then the turn \\nsignal flashes at 90 flashes per minute with a 75% ± 2% current “on-time.” \\n \\nWithin 3 minutes after the completion of  the 24th cycle, the air flow test will \\nbegin. The following procedure is to occur:    \\nThe mounted assembly is removed, placed in an insulating box and covered with foam material so that t here is no visible air space around \\nthe assembly;   The box is closed, taken to the ai r flow test chamber, and placed within \\nit. Inside the chamber, the assembly with respect to the air flow, is \\noriented in its design operating position;  \\n    719 \\nThe assembly is positioned in the chambe r so that the cent er of the lens \\nis in the center of t he opening of the air flow en try duct during the test;  \\n The headlamp has at least 3 inches clearance on all sides, and at least 4 inches to the entry and exit ducts at the closest points;   If vent tubes are used which extend bel ow the lamp body, the 3 inches \\nare measured from the bo ttom of the vent tube or its protection;  \\n The temperature of the chamber is 73°+7°-0° F (23°+4°-0° C) with a \\nrelative humidity of 30%+10%-0%;   The headlamp is not energized. \\n \\nBefore the test specified in parag raph S14.6.7.1.7 of FMVSS No. 108, the \\nuniformity of the air flow in the empt y test chamber at a plane 4 inches \\ndownstream of the air entry  duct is measured over a 4-inch square grid. The \\nuniformity of air flow at eac h grid point is ±10% of t he average air flow specified \\nin paragraph S14.6.7. 1.7 of FMVSS No. 108. \\n \\nThe mounted assembly in the chamber is  exposed, for one hour, to an average \\nair flow of 330+0-30 ft/min. as measur ed with an air velocity measuring probe \\nhaving an accuracy of ±3% in the 330 ft/m in range. The average air flow is the \\naverage of the velocity recorded at six points around the perimet er of the lens. \\nThe six points are determined as follows: At  the center of t he lens, construct a \\nhorizontal plane. The first two points are located in the plane, 1 inch outward \\nfrom the intersection of the plane and eac h edge of the lens. Then, trisect the \\ndistance between these two points and constr uct longitudinal vertical planes at \\nthe two intermediate locations formed by  the trisection. The four remaining \\npoints are located in the vertical pl anes, one inch above the top edge of the \\nlens, and one inch below the bottom edge of the lens. \\n \\nAfter one hour, the headlamp is remo ved and inspected for moisture. \\n \\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS     \\n \\nAfter completion of the humidity test, the sample headlamp must show no \\nevidence of interior delamination or moisture, fogging or condensation visible \\nwithout magnification.  \\n \\nVIBRATION TEST \\n \\nSAMPLES \\n \\nThe mounting bracket with a sample headlamp installed must not have a \\nresonant frequency in the 10-55 Hz. range.    \\n    720 \\nPROCEDURE  \\n \\nThe mounted sample headlamp is bolted to  the anvil end of the table of the \\nvibration test machine of Figure 21 and vibrated 750 cpm through a distance of \\n1/8 in.  The table is spring mounted at one end and fitted with steel calks on the \\nunderside of the other end.  The table is of  sufficient size to completely contain \\nthe test fixture base with no overhang. T he calks are to make contact with the \\nsteel anvil once during each cycl e at the completion of the fall.  The rack is \\noperated under a spring tension of 60 to 70 lb.  The vibration is applied in the \\nvertical axis of the headlam p as mounted on the vehicle.  Bulb filaments are not \\nenergized during the test. The te st is continued for 1 hour. \\n \\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS \\n \\nAfter completion of the vibration test, there must be no evidence of loose or \\nbroken parts, other than filaments, visible without magnification. \\n \\nSEALING TEST \\n \\nPROCEDURE  \\nAn unfixtured sample headlamp in its des ign mounting position is placed in \\nwater at a temperature of  176°±5° F (60°±3° C) for one hour. The headlamp is \\nenergized in its highest wattage mode, wit h the test voltage at 12.8±0.1 V. \\nduring immersion.  \\n \\nThe lamp is then de-energized and i mmediately submerged in its design \\nmounting position into water at 32° +5° -0° F (0° +3° -0° C). The water is in a \\npressurized vessel, and the pressure is increased to 10 psi (70 kPa), upon \\nplacing the lamp in the water. The lamp must remain in the pressurized vessel for a period of thirty minutes.  \\n \\nThis entire procedure is repeated for four cycles. \\n \\nThen the lamp is inspected for any signs of  water on its interior.  During the high \\ntemperature portion of the cycles, the lamp is observed for signs of air escaping \\nfrom its interior. \\n \\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS     \\n \\nAfter completion of the sealing test, a sample headlamp confirmed to be sealed \\nneed not meet the corrosion test, dust test, or  humidity test of th is Section.

Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

This specification is \\ntighter than is required by applicable regulations. \\n2. Non-Headlamps:  All replaceable, i.e.  non-sealed in lamp, bulbs must have the \\nfilaments (if any) positioned within +/- 0. 25 mm (0.010 inch) axially, vertically and \\nhorizontally of design location relative to the lamp, as specified in SAE J573d or by \\nthe bulb manufacturer.  \\nNOTE: This requirement derives fr om the FMVSS/CMVSS regulation which \\nreferences SAE J575e (Aug. 1980) (which references SAE J387). \\n \\n(b) Conditioning:  All bulbs used for photomet ric and wattage tests must be conditioned before \\nthe first use by operating at nominal design voltage for one percent of their average rated \\nlaboratory life.   \\n(c) On-Time: \\n1. Incandescent filament(s), allow a minimum of three minutes to stabilize the output of \\nthe bulb(s) prior to making maximum and minimum measurements. \\n2. Other light emitting devices, determi ne their performance characteristics in \\nrelationship to light output vs. time. Measur e and record the light output of the device \\nfor the worst case condition if significant changes in performance occur and document the duration of the on-time. \\n3. LED lighting devices, measure and reco rd the maximum output of the device \\nimmediately (within 60 sec.) after applying pow er to the device; allow internal heat \\nbuildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization time,  prior to measuring and recording individual test point data; and for the dust test, measure and record the maximum output of the device after internal heat bu ildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization \\ntime. \\nNOTE: This requirement der ives from SAE J1889 Oct93.

Use the \\nmirror on the slave fixture to reset t he horizontal zero. Mount the headlamp on \\nthe test fixture. \\nb) Adjust the vertical aim of t he \"VOR\" or \"VOL\" headlamp as follows: \\n1. Energize the low beam filament at 12.8 V DC and visually adjust the aim of \\nthe headlamp until the upper cutoff at 2 °R is on the horizontal (0.0 °D) for \\nVOR or 2.5 °L is at 0.4 °D for VOL . \\nThis aiming should be done on a test screen at least 25 feet from the lamp. \\n2. Fine tune the aim using the com puter software by scanning in  0.10 ° \\nincrements from 1.5 ° U to 1.5 ° D at 2° R for VOR or 2.5 °L for VOL to \\ndetermine the point at which the maximum gradient occurs. \\nUse software or the following formula to find the maximum gradient: G=logE(a) - logE(a+0.1)           where G=gradient,  a=vetical angular position (degrees) , E(a)=candela. The maximum gradient must \"be not less than .13…\" otherwise record that the \\nCENTER GRADIENT FAILED.  \\n3. After finding the vertical location of the maximum gradient, the software/ \\noperator must set: a) the maximum gradient of VOR headlamps to be at the \\nvertical zero (0.0 °D) of the goniometer, or b) the maximum gradient of VOL \\nheadlamps to be at 0.4D. \\n4. Scan in  0.10 ° increments from 1.5 ° U to1.5° D at the locations: 1 °R and 3°R \\nfor VOR (i.e., the ends of minimum width) and 1.5°L and 3.5 °L for VOL (i.e., \\nthe ends of minimum width) to determine the maximum gradients (or \\ninclinations) at these locations.  \\n5. If  the maximum gradients measured at : 1°R and 3°R for VOR and 1.5 °L and \\n3.5°L for VOL are not vertically within +/- 0.2 °of the maximum gradients  at: \\n2°R for VOR or 2.5 °L for VOL,  record that the END GRADIENT FAILED AT \\nand specify the horizontal angle . \\n6. If the gradients at the ends of the mi nimum width are within the required +/- \\n0.2, then Go to step 5.1.1.(d) Low beam Measurement.  \\nNOTE: In the future multiple light sources may be permitted, if they are \\nlegal and required by a particular design and some sources are independently adjustable in relation to the first, repeat the previous steps for the additional independently aimable light sources. \\n4.

These measurements should use the 1 degree reaim (2 degree cone) \\npermitted in Step 6 .  \\n5. Record the table number and standard,  i.e. FMVSS, CMVSS, F/CMVSS or SAE J \\nXXX and date, used as a Pass/Fail criteria on the data sheet.  Indicate whether the \\ndata  \"PASSED\" or FAILED\" all required acceptance criteria. \\nNOTE:  The following step, i.e. 6, must be  performed for: \\n1. all Certification tests where phot ometry evaluation is referenced, \\n2. but only for those DV tests in wh ich photometry is the only evaluation. \\nThe performance of Step 4 results in t he most upward glare region evaluation \\nbeing conducted with the commonly used interpretation, of measuring across an applicable  horizontal line and up a vertical  line at the point where the highest \\nreading on the applicable horizontal line wa s obtained.  This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA\\'s contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6. Visually locate\\n within the region 10U to 90U - L to R any areas that are receiving \\nexcessively bright light. If such an area ex ists, scan the bright area to locate the \\napparent maximum intensity location and record the candlepower value and the position. Also record the candlepower va lue and position of all points within a 1 \\ndegree radius about the apparent maximum intensity location at 0.125 degree intervals. Find the actual highest intensity location by determining the center of the \\nhighest values obtained.  \\nActual highest intensity cd values that  are greater than 438 cd should be noted as \\nexceeding the maximum (FAIL), in addition, values exceeding 125 cd should also be \\nmarked as exceeding the maximum (FAIL), unless a 125 cd or lower value can be \\nfound within a 2 degree cone (1 degree reai m) around the actual highest intensity.  \\nNOTE:  The 2 degree cone is defined in  the rationale of  SAE J1383 JUN 90 and \\nalso in ECE R48 as the maximum area of spots of light that can exceed \\nthe maximum candlepower applied, i.e. 125 cd, to portions of the beam  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

However, ask the OEM to specify the nominal design voltage for the function \\nwhich could be different for the wiring, swit ching, resistors, voltage reduction modules \\netc. \\n  2. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage for 30 min, THEN run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with mi nimum requirements.   Also determine the \\nmaximum intensity location. \\n \\n3. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage and IMMEDIATELY run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with maxi mum requirements within 60 seconds, that is \\nbetween 0 and 60.49 seconds).   \\n \\n4. For lamps like CHMSLs with a maximum zone (10L to 10R and from 10U to 5D) (typically \\nalso equal to the furthest test points), test the PREDETERMINED maximum location \\nwithin the zone.  Give a 1/4 degree reaim to any test point or maximum intensity location \\nthat exceeds that maximum permitted candela.   Any test measurement which exceeds \\nthe maximum shall be remeasured at a time approaching, but not exceeding 60.49 \\nseconds, i.e. 50-60 seconds, since test meas urements taken it the earlier part of the \\nallotted 60 seconds, i.e., 0-10 or even at  10-20 seconds, may be higher than would be \\nobtained later in the allotted time period.  If multiple test points have maximums, it is \\npermitted to repeat the test at many times as  necessary to test all test points with \\nmaximums within the latter portion of the allotted time, i.e., 50-60 seconds. \\n \\n5.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon\\'s customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \"photom etric laboratories\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.

Issued:  6/24/98   Revised:  08/31/00   Revision Level 4.0 \\nCONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 80 11/4/2011 (per SAE J1330 section 3.2.2).  Positioner accuracy is controlled by G805WI-LL-C-\\n001. \\n3. The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\"  Thus, \"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \"designed \\nnominal position.\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \"designed nominal positi on\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.  These bulbs are reca librated per G805-LL-C-001in accord with SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.8.3, except the annual recalibration has been replaced with a \\noperating time based calibration, which is  based on the interval recommended by the \\ncalibrating laboratory. \\n7. Note, that  there are filament or light source parameters that are not controlled in \\naccurate rated bulbs and these parameter s in \"some lighting devices may produce \\nsignificantly different luminous intensity measurements with two different accurate \\nrated bulbs, particularly lighting devices wi th particularly short focal lengths.\" SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.6). \\n8. The sensor/photometer system is desi gned and used within the guidelines for color \\nresponse, HID source use, range linearit y and sensor aperture size that are \\ncontained within SAE J1330 JUN94 sections 3. 7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3,  3.7.4 and 3.7.5.

Also, the outboard contains a CAN Transceiver, a LED Matrix Manager \\n(LMM), and receives from the SLM power and com munication for the LMM.  \\nDRL and TI functions are both within a single PCB. Both functions are achieved through a double dye LED.   \\nThe TI provide a swiping turn function , which start turn at 100% ON and then turn OFF each LED one by one \\nfrom inboard to outb oard. Requires additional matrix manager to indivitually control each turn LED for the \\nswiping anumation.  \\nAnimation sequence as sh own below:  \\n \\n \\nLow Beam and High Beam are both divided in two boards inside a double projector . \\n \\n \\n  \\n   Test Plan for CS.0005 6 \\nApproval #:    Original Date Published: January 2018  \\n   \\n Page 7 \\n Copyright Stellantis 2024  \\n DUT Pinout Information  \\nFunction and Test Mode Information base (BIN #)  \\n \\n \\nFunction and Test Mode Information base (BIN #)  \\nPIN\\n# Color  Signal \\nDescription  V / I \\n(Min)  V / I \\n(Nom)  V / I \\n(Max)  Comments  \\n1  PWR  9V – TBD 13.5V – 8.7A 16V - TBD Power  \\n2  Ignition  9V – TBD 13.5V – 0.2A 16V - TBD Input  \\n3  GND  - - - GND for external loads  \\n4  PGND  - - - Power  \\nPIN\\n# Color  Signal \\nDescription  V / I \\n(Min)  V / I \\n(Nom)  V / I \\n(Max)  Comments  \\n1  N/A - - - Output  \\n2  N/A - - - Output  \\n3  Signature \\nAnode  38V 42V – 0.4A 45V Output  \\n4  Signature \\nCathode  - - - Output  \\n5  Outage  9V 13.5V  – 0.2A 16V Output  \\n6  PWR 5V  4.5V 5V – 0.2A 5.5V Output  \\n7  GND  - - - Input \\n8  CAN H  9V 13.5V – 0.1A 16V Output  \\n9  CAN L  9V 13.5V – 0.1A 16V Output  \\n10  Cove Anode  10V 12V – 0.5A 15V Output  \\n11  Cove \\nCathode  - - - Output  \\n12  UART / CAN \\nL (GL)  9V 13.5V – 0.1A 16V Output  \\n13  UART / CAN \\nH (GL)  9V 13.5V – 0.1A 16V Output  \\n14  N/A - - - N/A \\n15  N/A - - - Output  \\n16  N/A - - - Output     Test Plan for CS.0005 6 \\nApproval #:    Original Date Published: January 2018  \\n   \\n Page 8 \\n Copyright Stellantis 2024  \\n \\n \\n4 Function and test mode information  \\n Functions of the DUT  \\nFunctions  \\nHigh Beam  \\nLow Beam  \\nDRL \\nSwiping Turn \\nPark \\nSignature  \\n Operation modes.  \\n4.2.1  Operating mode for the component  \\nOperating Mode  Electrical State  \\nOM1  No voltage is applied to the DUT  \\nA DUT is not connected to wiring harness (component transportation mode)  \\nB DUT is connected to wiring harness, but not voltage is applied  \\nOM2  The DUT is electrically connected with supply voltage U B engine not running (example: any \\ncomponent connected to battery power in the vehicle or internal component battery - \\nexample: Tire pressure monitor, key fob, etc.) as in a vehicle with all applicable electrical \\nconnection made  \\nA DUT functions are not activated (e.g., sleep mode, OFF mode, long time parking, \\netc.) \\nB DUT is electrically operated and controlled in typical operating mode for any CAN \\nor LIN bus messages communicated during vehicle operation (includes \\nmechanical cycling involving switches, relays, actuators and sensors).  \\nOM3  The DUT is electrically supplied with voltage U A (engine/alternator active) with all applicable \\nelectrical connections made (example: Any component connected to battery power in the \\nvehicle, or using internal component battery voltage as in case of Tire pressure monitor, key \\nfob, etc.).  \\nA DUT functions are not activated (e.g., sleep mode, OFF mode) except default \\nfunctions (e.g., CAN, LIN, etc.).  \\nB DUT is electrically and/or mechanically operated on controlled in typical operating \\nmode (includes mechanical cycling involving switches, relays, actuators and \\nsensors).  \\n \\n  \\n   Test Plan for CS.0005 6 \\nApproval #:    Original Date Published: January 2018  \\n   \\n Page 9 \\n Copyright Stellantis 2024  \\n4.2.2  Typical classification of component weight and soak time   \\nComponent Weight  Default Soak Time  Wt.

This test could be separated as special test leg in case of timing bottleneck.  If a separate test leg is used to \\noptimize test time, use 1 additional pre-conditioned samples from test legs 1, 2 & 3 for Mechical Operating Endurance \\nwith 2 fresh samples.  Test flow shall be customized separately for this purpose (this is not automatic)\\nNOTE 7 : If there are any failures, detailed root cause analysis (RCA) will be conducted to prevent the failure. Pre-\\nconditioning will not be required for revalidation if the design does not include any PCB layout or component changes. \\nVerification requirement will be determined by Stellantis Quality & Engineering based on the RCA.\\nNOTE 10 :  It is acceptable for the supplier to use the Alternate Test flow per CS.00056 in lieu of the Standard Test flow \\nshown above.NOTE 8 :  Handling Drop Test is only applicable to servicable electronic components.  \\nNOTE 9 : EMC component & Electrical System, Connectors & Wiring System are not part of the Environmental Test \\nFlow.

Headlamps shall be so made as to  retain their prescribed photometric \\ncharacteristics and to remain in good working order when in normal use, in spite of the vibrations to which they may be subjected. \\n 5.2.1. Headlamps shall be fitted with a device enabling them to be so adjusted on the \\nvehicles as to comply with the rules applicable to them.  Such a device need not be fitted on units in wh ich the reflector and the diffusing lens cannot be \\nseparated, provided the use of such units is confined to vehicles on which the \\nheadlamp setting can be adjusted by other means.  \\n \\n                                                \\n \\n5/  Technical requirements for fila ment lamps: see Regulation No. 37.  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 13   \\n \\n Where a headlamp providing a passing beam and a headlamp providing a \\ndriving beam, each equipped with its ow n filament lamp, are assembled to \\nform a composite unit the adjusting device shall enable each optical system individually to be duly adjusted. \\n 5.2.2. However, these provisions shall not apply to headlamp assemblies whose \\nreflectors are indivisible. For this t ype of assembly the requirements of \\nparagraph 6.3. of this Regulation apply. \\n 5.3. The headlamp shall be equipped with filament lamp(s) approved according to \\nRegulation No. 37.  Any Regulation N o. 37 filament lamp may be used, \\nprovided that no restriction on the applica tion is made in the table of contents \\nof Regulation No. 37. 6\\n/ \\n 5.4. The components by which a filament lamp is fixed to the reflector shall be so \\nmade that, even in darkness, the filament lamp can be fixed in no position but the correct one. 7\\n/ \\n 5.5. The filament lamp holder shall confor m to the characteristics given in IEC \\nPublication 61-2, third edit ion, 1969.  The holder data sheet relevant to the \\ncategory of filament lamp used, applies. \\n 5.6. Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic may be adapted for traffic on a given side of the road either by an \\nappropriate initial setting when fitted on the vehicle or by selective setting by \\nthe user. Such initial or selective setti ng may consist, for example, of fixing \\neither the optical unit at a given angle on the vehicle or the filament lamp at a \\ngiven angle in relation to the optical unit. In all cas es, only two different and \\nclearly distinct settings, one for right-h and and one for left-hand traffic, shall \\nbe possible, and the design shall pr eclude inadvertent shifting from one \\nsetting to the other or setting in an in termediate position. Where two different \\nsetting positions are provided for th e filament lamp, the components for \\nattaching the filament lamp to the re flector must be so designed and made \\n                                                \\n \\n6/  HIR1 and/or H9 filament lamps shall only be permitted to produce passing beam in \\nconjunction with the insta llation of headlamp cleani ng device(s) conforming to \\nRegulation No. 45.  In addition, with respect  to vertical inclin ation, the provision of \\nparagraph 6.2.6.2.2. of Regulation N o. 48, 01 series of amendments, shall not be applied when \\nthese lamps are installed. \\n  This restriction shall apply as long as there is no general agreement on the use of levelling \\ndevices and headlamp cleaners with respect to the level of the perfor mance of the headlamp. \\n7\\n/  A headlamp is regarded as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the filament lamp \\ncan be easily fitted into the headlamp and the pos itioning lugs can be correctly fitted into their \\nslots even in darkness.

Conformity with the requirements of this pa ragraph shall be verified \\nby visual inspection and, wher e necessary, by a test fitting. \\n 5.7. Complementary tests shall be done acco rding to the requirements of Annex 4 \\nto ensure that in use there is no exce ssive change in photometric performance. \\n 5.8. If the lens of the headlamp is of plas tic material, tests sh all be done according \\nto the requirements of Annex 6. \\n 5.9. On headlamps designed to provide alte rnately a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, or a passing beam and/or a driv ing beam designed to become bend \\nlighting, any mechanical, el ectromechanical or other device incorporated in \\nthe headlamp for these purposes shall be so constructed that: \\n 5.9.1. the device is strong enough to with stand 50,000 operations without suffering \\ndamage despite the vibrations to whic h it may be subjected in normal use; \\n 5.9.2. in the case of failure the illumination above the line H-H shall not exceed the \\nvalues of a passing beam according to paragraph 6.2.5.; in addition, on headlamps designed to provide a passing and/or a driving beam to become a \\nbend lighting, a minimum illumination of at least 5 lux shall be fulfilled in test point 25 V (VV line, D 75 cm). \\n 5.9.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without \\nany possibility of the mechanis m stopping in between two positions; \\n 5.9.4. the user cannot, with ordi nary tools, change the shape or position of the \\nmoving parts. \\n 6. ILLUMINATION  6.1. General provisions\\n \\n 6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that th ey give adequate illumination without \\ndazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting the driving beam. \\n 6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of \\na vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its \\naxes as shown in Annex 3 to this Regulation. \\n 6.1.3. The headlamps shall be checked by mean s of an uncoloured standard (\\u00e9talon) \\nfilament lamp designed for a rated volta ge of 12 V.  During the checking of  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 15   \\n \\n the headlamp, the voltage at the terminals of the filament lamp shall be \\nregulated so as to obtain the refere nce luminous flux as indicated at the \\nrelevant data sheet of Regulation No. 37. \\n 6.1.4. The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of \\nthis paragraph 6 with at least one sta ndard (\\u00e9talon) filament lamp, which may \\nbe submitted with the headlamp. \\n 6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2.

In the case of a headlamp designed to  provide a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, measurements of the illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall be taken with the same headlamp alignment as for measurements under paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. above; in the case of a \\nheadlamp providing a driving beam only, it shall be so adjusted that the area \\nof maximum illumination is centred on th e point of intersection of lines hh \\nand vv; such a headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in \\nparagraph 6.3. \\n 6.3.2. It is possible to use several light sources for the driving beam.  6.3.3. The illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements. \\n 6.3.3.1. The point of intersection (HV) of lines hh and vv shall be si tuated within the \\nisolux 80 per cent of maximum illumination. This maximum value (E\\nM) shall \\nnot be less than 32 lux for Class A headlamps and 48 lux for Class B \\nheadlamps.  The maximum value shall in no circumstances exceed 240 lux; in \\naddition, in the case of a combined passing and driving headlamp, this \\nmaximum value shall not be more than  16 times the illumination measured for \\nthe passing beam at point 75 R (or 75 L). \\n 6.3.3.1.1. The maximum intensity (I\\nM) of the driving beam e xpressed in thousands of \\ncandelas shall be calculated by the formula: \\n  I\\nM = 0.625 E M \\n 6.3.3.1.2. The reference mark (I\\n'\\nM) of this maximum intensity, referred to in \\nparagraph 4.2.2.7. above, shall be obtained by the ratio: \\n \\n  \\n \\n I'I\\n30.208  EMM\\nM == E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 19   \\n \\n This value shall be rounded off to the value 7.5 - 10 - 12.5 - 17.5 - 20 - 25 - \\n27.5 - 30 - 37.5 - 40 - 45 - 50. \\n 6.3.3.2.

In the case of headlamps with adju stable reflector the requirements of \\nparagraphs 6.2. and 6.3. are applicable for each mounting position indicated according to paragraph 2.1.3.  For verifi cation the following procedure shall \\nbe used: \\n 6.4.1. Each applied position is realized on the test goniometer with respect to a line \\njoining the centre of the light source  and point HV on a aiming screen.  The \\nadjustable reflector is then moved into such a position that the light pattern on \\nthe screen corresponds to the aiming pr escriptions of paragraphs 6.2.1. to \\n6.2.2.3. and/or 6.3.1; \\n 6.4.2. with the reflector initially fixed acco rding to paragraph 6.4.1., the headlamp \\nmust meet the relevant photometric re quirements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3; \\n \\n6.4.3. additional tests are made after the reflector has been moved vertically \\u00b1 2\\u00b0 or \\nat least into the maximum position, if less than 2\\u00b0, from its initial position by \\nmeans of the headlamps adjusting device. Having re-aimed the headlamp as a whole (by means of the goniometer fo r example) in the corresponding \\nopposite direction the light output in the following directions shall be \\ncontrolled and lie within the required limits: \\n \\npassing beam : points HV and 75 R (75 L respectively); driving beam : E\\nM and point HV (percentage of E M). \\n \\n6.4.4. if the applicant has not indicated more than one mounting position,  the \\nprocedure of paragraphs 6.4.1. to 6.4.3. shall be repeated for all other \\npositions; \\n 6.4.5. if the applicant has no t asked for special mounti ng positions, the headlamp \\nshall be aimed for measurements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3. with the \\nheadlamps adjusting device in its m ean position.  The additional test of \\nparagraph 6.4.3. shall be made with the reflector moved into its extreme positions (instead of \\n+ 2\\u00b0) by means of the headlamps adjusting device. \\n 6.5. The screen illumination values mentioned in paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and \\n6.3. above shall be measured by means of a photo receptor, the effective area of which shall be contained within a square of 65 mm side.

Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

Energize the low beam filament at 12.8 V DC and visually adjust the aim of \\nthe headlamp until the upper cutoff at 2 \\u00b0R is on the horizontal (0.0 \\u00b0D) for \\nVOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L is at 0.4 \\u00b0D for VOL . \\nThis aiming should be done on a test screen at least 25 feet from the lamp. \\n2. Fine tune the aim using the com puter software by scanning in  0.10 \\u00b0 \\nincrements from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to 1.5 \\u00b0 D at 2\\u00b0 R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL to \\ndetermine the point at which the maximum gradient occurs. \\nUse software or the following formula to find the maximum gradient: G=logE(a) - logE(a+0.1)           where G=gradient,  a=vetical angular position (degrees) , E(a)=candela. The maximum gradient must \\\"be not less than .13\\u2026\\\" otherwise record that the \\nCENTER GRADIENT FAILED.  \\n3. After finding the vertical location of the maximum gradient, the software/ \\noperator must set: a) the maximum gradient of VOR headlamps to be at the \\nvertical zero (0.0 \\u00b0D) of the goniometer, or b) the maximum gradient of VOL \\nheadlamps to be at 0.4D. \\n4.

This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.

The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.  These bulbs are reca librated per G805-LL-C-001in accord with SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.8.3, except the annual recalibration has been replaced with a \\noperating time based calibration, which is  based on the interval recommended by the \\ncalibrating laboratory. \\n7. Note, that  there are filament or light source parameters that are not controlled in \\naccurate rated bulbs and these parameter s in \\\"some lighting devices may produce \\nsignificantly different luminous intensity measurements with two different accurate \\nrated bulbs, particularly lighting devices wi th particularly short focal lengths.\\\" SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.6). \\n8. The sensor/photometer system is desi gned and used within the guidelines for color \\nresponse, HID source use, range linearit y and sensor aperture size that are \\ncontained within SAE J1330 JUN94 sections 3. 7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3,  3.7.4 and 3.7.5.

CONTROL PLAN - \\n \\nThe Manufacturing Plant and Viste on Product Engineering Office will jo intly determine which potential \\nprocess changes would have signi ficant impact on the product's func tion, performance, durability or \\nappearance.  The manufacturing plant will describe th ese process changes in th e Control Plan, along with \\neither (1) the revalidation plan th at would be followed in each case, or (2) a provision to submit an \\namended Control Plan for approval if any of those pr ocess changes are planned. No change to processing \\nmay be allowed without prior engineering approval of the process changes and the attendant Control Plan \\nchanges.   \\nB. DESIGN CHANGES - \\n Any changes in material or material sources must be revalidated for durability and material compatibility.  Any changes in material, design or tooling must be evaluated for their potential impact on: \\n1)  the real world safety of the vehicle,  \\n2)  the homologation status of the vehicle,  \\n3)  the self certification status  per FMVSS/CMVSS/ADR/etc.,  \\n4)  the ability to meet the customers safety design guidelines,  \\n5)  the crash performance of the vehicle and/or component and \\n6)  the customers safety related compliance requirements, i.e. WCR. \\n \\nThe potential impact of any of the above fact ors should be communicated  in writing to both: \\na)  the customer safety/regulatory representative via WERS or equivalent or email and  \\nb)  the Regulatory Compliance Engineer for Exterior Lighting  \\nwho shall provide assistance in determining what tests must be done (if any) to demonstrate that certification and/or homologation complia nce, safety factors/acceptance crite ria and safety related customer \\nrequirements have not been compromised.  \\n  \\nC.  AIMING PAD (NIB) EVALUATION - \\n \\nConduct an annual engineering evalua tion.  A suggested amount of 3 pair/cavity combination of each \\nheadlamp shall be submitted to the product engineering lighting laboratory for verifi cation of correct aim.  \\nIf the aim is found outside acceptable limits the amount of  adjustment required to the aiming pads will be \\nprovided by engineering.  \\n  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

Production Lot - The total number of parts per hand, per cavity, per carline, manufactured during one  \\nproduction shift.  \\n B. Production Unit - The total number of parts of one type produced by one manufacturing group of \\nmachines (assembly line during one production shift). \\n C. Prime Source - The plant where the part is act ually being manufactured, or that plant which  \\n performs the operation which controls the characteristics.  The part may not necessarily be supplied  directly to the customer, but may be shipped to a second supplier or manufacturing plant.  In some \\ninstances, an OEM plant ma y be the prime source. \\n D. Replaceable Bulb Headlamp - Shall include h eadlamp assembly (13005-6) , wiring connector male \\nsleeve assembly (14A464) and 16 gage wire (ESF-MIL 56A) unless specified otherwise.  For testing, \\nheadlamp breathing devices or other design openi ngs shall be in their normal operating positions \\nunless otherwise specified. \\n E. Seasoning -   Process of energizing the filament of a headlamp at design voltage for a period of time  equivalent to 1% of average rated laboratory life.  Other equivalent methods are acceptable. \\n F.           Control Plans address all significant design and process characteristics, including all Control Item \\ncharacteristics.  They describe the process pot ential studies that will be performed for product \\nvalidation (including certification and PSW tests)  and the ongoing product and process evaluation for \\ncontinuing improvement (i ncluding IP tests).  They include  acceptance criteria, sample sizes, \\nfrequencies, data analysis methods and reaction plans. \\n \\nThe Control Plan is developed, and updated as necessary, by the ma nufacturing source in conjunction  \\n with the design responsible Product Engineering ac tivity and other appropriate functions such as \\nSTA. The Control Plan defines the management of th e upstream production process and part variables \\n (significant process characteristics)  that affect the outcome of the laboratory tests or other significant \\ndesign characteristics.  The Control Plan also identifies the specific laboratory tests, with their sample \\nsizes and frequencies, that will be performed in order to: \\n \\n        . Confirm whether the process is being managed effectively.         . Further identify significant process characteristics. \\n        . Evaluate performance of marginal processes.         .

The definitions given in Regulation N o. 48 and its series of amendments in \\nforce at the time of application for type approval shall apply to this \\nRegulation. \\n 2. APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF A HEADLAMP  2.1. The application for approval shall be  submitted by the owner of the trade \\nname or mark or by his duly accredite d representative. It  shall specify: \\n 2.1.1.  whether the headlamp is intended to provide both a passing beam and a \\ndriving beam or only one of these beams; \\n 2.1.2. whether, if the headlamp is intended to provide a passing beam, it is designed \\nfor both left-hand and right-hand traffic or for either left-hand or right-hand \\ntraffic only; \\n 2.1.3. if the headlamp is equipped with an adjustable reflector, the mounting \\nposition(s) of the headlamp in relation to the ground and the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle; \\n 2.1.4. whether it concerns a Class A or B headlamp;  2.1.5. the category of the filament lamp(s) used, as listed in Regulation No. 37. \\n 2.2. Every application for approval shall be accompanied by:  2.2.1. drawings in triplicate in sufficient de tail to permit identification of the type \\nand representing a frontal view of the h eadlamp, with details of lens ribbing if \\nany, and the cross-section; the drawings  shall indicate the space reserved for \\nthe approval mark; \\n 2.2.1.1. if the headlamp is equipped with an adjustable reflector, an indication of the \\nmounting position(s) of the headlamp  in relation to the ground and the \\nlongitudinal median plane of the vehicle, if the headlamp is for use in that (those) position(s) only; \\n 2.2.2. a brief technical descrip tion including, in the case where headlamps are used \\nto produce bend lighting, the extreme positions acc ording to paragraph 6.2.9. \\nbelow; \\n 2.2.3. two samples of the type of headlamp.  2.2.4. For the test of plastic material  of which the lenses are made: \\n 2.2.4.1. thirteen lenses;  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 7   \\n \\n 2.2.4.1.1. six of these lenses may be replaced  by six samples of material at least \\n60 x 80 mm in size, having a flat or convex outer surface and a substantially flat area (radius of curv ature not less than 300 mm)  in the middle measuring \\nat least 15 x 15 mm; \\n 2.2.4.1.2. every such lens or sample of materi al shall be produced by the method to be \\nused in mass production; \\n 2.2.4.2. a reflector to which the lenses can be fitted in accordance with the \\nmanufacturer's instructions. \\n 2.3. The materials making up the lenses a nd coatings, if any, shall be accompanied \\nby the test report of the characteristics of  these materials and coatings if they \\nhave already been tested. \\n 3. MARKINGS 2\\n/ \\n 3.1. Headlamps submitted for approval shall b ear the trade name or mark of the \\napplicant. \\n 3.2. They shall comprise, on the lens and on the main body, 3\\n/ spaces of sufficient \\nsize for the approval mark and the additional symbols referred to in paragraph 4; these spaces shall be indicat ed on the drawings referred to in \\nparagraph 2.2.1. above. \\n 3.3. Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic shall bear mark ings indicating the two sett ings of the optical unit \\non the vehicle or of the filament lamp  on the reflector; these markings shall \\nconsist of the letters \\\"R/D\\\" for the position for right-hand traffic and the \\nletters \\\"L/G\\\" for the position for left-hand traffic. \\n \\n    \\n                                                \\n \\n2/  In the case of headlamps designed to meet th e requirements of traffic moving on one side of \\nthe road only (either right or left), it is further recommended that the area which can be occulted to prevent discomfort to users in a country wh ere traffic moves on the side of the road opposite \\nto that of the country for which the headlamp was designed should be outlined indelibly on the \\nfront lens. This marking is not necessary, however , where the area is clearly apparent from the \\ndesign. \\n3\\n/  If the lens cannot be detached from th e main body of the headlamp, a unique marking  as per \\nparagraph 4.2.5.  shall be sufficient.  \\n  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505 } Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112  \\npage 8  \\n \\n 4.

Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic may be adapted for traffic on a given side of the road either by an \\nappropriate initial setting when fitted on the vehicle or by selective setting by \\nthe user. Such initial or selective setti ng may consist, for example, of fixing \\neither the optical unit at a given angle on the vehicle or the filament lamp at a \\ngiven angle in relation to the optical unit. In all cas es, only two different and \\nclearly distinct settings, one for right-h and and one for left-hand traffic, shall \\nbe possible, and the design shall pr eclude inadvertent shifting from one \\nsetting to the other or setting in an in termediate position. Where two different \\nsetting positions are provided for th e filament lamp, the components for \\nattaching the filament lamp to the re flector must be so designed and made \\n                                                \\n \\n6/  HIR1 and/or H9 filament lamps shall only be permitted to produce passing beam in \\nconjunction with the insta llation of headlamp cleani ng device(s) conforming to \\nRegulation No. 45.

Complementary tests shall be done acco rding to the requirements of Annex 4 \\nto ensure that in use there is no exce ssive change in photometric performance. \\n 5.8. If the lens of the headlamp is of plas tic material, tests sh all be done according \\nto the requirements of Annex 6. \\n 5.9. On headlamps designed to provide alte rnately a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, or a passing beam and/or a driv ing beam designed to become bend \\nlighting, any mechanical, el ectromechanical or other device incorporated in \\nthe headlamp for these purposes shall be so constructed that: \\n 5.9.1. the device is strong enough to with stand 50,000 operations without suffering \\ndamage despite the vibrations to whic h it may be subjected in normal use; \\n 5.9.2. in the case of failure the illumination above the line H-H shall not exceed the \\nvalues of a passing beam according to paragraph 6.2.5.; in addition, on headlamps designed to provide a passing and/or a driving beam to become a \\nbend lighting, a minimum illumination of at least 5 lux shall be fulfilled in test point 25 V (VV line, D 75 cm). \\n 5.9.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without \\nany possibility of the mechanis m stopping in between two positions; \\n 5.9.4. the user cannot, with ordi nary tools, change the shape or position of the \\nmoving parts. \\n 6. ILLUMINATION  6.1. General provisions\\n \\n 6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that th ey give adequate illumination without \\ndazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting the driving beam. \\n 6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of \\na vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its \\naxes as shown in Annex 3 to this Regulation. \\n 6.1.3. The headlamps shall be checked by mean s of an uncoloured standard (\\u00e9talon) \\nfilament lamp designed for a rated volta ge of 12 V.

The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of \\nthis paragraph 6 with at least one sta ndard (\\u00e9talon) filament lamp, which may \\nbe submitted with the headlamp. \\n 6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:  6.2.2.1. in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand \\ntraffic, the \\\"cut-off\\\" on the left-half of the screen 8\\n/ is horizontal and, in the \\ncase of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left -hand traffic, the \\n\\\"cut-off\\\" on the right-half of the screen is horizontal; \\n 6.2.2.2. this horizontal part of the \\\"cut-off\\\" is  situated on the sc reen 25 cm below the \\nlevel hh (see Annex 3);  \\n \\n6.2.2.3. the \\\"elbow\\\" of the \\\"c ut-off\\\" is on line vv. 9\\n/ \\n 6.2.3. When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely for \\nprovision of a passing beam, 10\\n/ comply only with the requirements set out in  \\n                                                 \\n8/  The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the \\\"cut-off\\\" over a range of \\nat least 5\\u00b0 on either side of the line vv. \\n \\n9/  If the beam does not have a cut-off with a clear \\\"elbow\\\", the lateral adjustment shall be \\neffected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for illumination at points 75 R and \\n50 R for right-hand traffic and for points  75 L and 50 L for left-hand traffic. \\n 10\\n/  Such a special \\\"passing beam\\\" headlamp ma y incorporate a driving beam not subject to \\nrequirements.

Where a headlamp so aimed does not meet the requirements set out in \\nparagraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and 6.3., its alignment may be changed, provided that the axis of the beam is not displ aced laterally by more than 1\\u00b0 (= 44 cm) \\nto the right or left. 11\\n/ To facilitate alignment by means of the \\\"cut-off\\\", the \\nheadlamp may be partially occulted in order to sharpen the \\\"cut-off\\\". \\n 6.2.5. The illumination produced on the screen by the passing beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements: \\n \\n6.2.6. There shall be no lateral va riations detrimental to good visibility in any of the \\nzones I, II, III and IV. \\n 6.2.7. The illumination values in zones \\\"A\\\" and \\\"B\\\" as shown in figure C in \\nAnnex 3 shall be checked by the measur ement of the photometric values of \\n                                                \\n \\n11/  The limit of realignment of 1\\u00b0 towards the right  or left is not incompatible with upward or \\ndownward vertical realig nment.

In the event that the principal light source fails, this additional light source shall be automatically switched off. \\n 6.2.10.3. In the event of failure of an addi tional light source, the headlamp shall \\ncontinue to fulfil the requirements of the passing beam. \\n 6.3. Provisions concerning driving beams\\n \\n 6.3.1. In the case of a headlamp designed to  provide a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, measurements of the illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall be taken with the same headlamp alignment as for measurements under paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. above; in the case of a \\nheadlamp providing a driving beam only, it shall be so adjusted that the area \\nof maximum illumination is centred on th e point of intersection of lines hh \\nand vv; such a headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in \\nparagraph 6.3. \\n 6.3.2.

REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING \\nNOTE: Refer to the test requirements of sect ions 4.1 and 4.1.4 of SAEJ1383 (APR85) for sample \\npreparation for applicable headlamp tests. \\n4.1  Sample Identification and Documentation \\n(a) The design responsible engineer for each part tested must sign a statement that must be \\nincluded in the test engineer's part certification report  that the parts and fixtures supplied for \\ntest are representative of the latest desi gn level approved for production, the device has been \\nmounted on the fixture in vehicle position us ing nominal design torque, and the device is \\napproved for testing. \\nNOTE: Not required for development,  non-certific ation DV tests, or in-process testing. \\n(b) For a headlamp used as a daytime running lamp , whether the lamp is exposed or concealed, \\ninclude the filament reduced voltage value, or, fo r a system that uses a DRL Module, provide \\na nominal module and part number. \\n(c) All parts being tested and related parts, i.e. sockets, which affect test results, must be \\nidentified by part number, including suffix, in the part drawing. Any deviation of test parts from \\nthose specified in the drawing must be documented by the design responsible engineer.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.  Issued:  6/24/98   Revised:  08/31/00   Revision Level 4.0 \\nCONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 80 11/4/2011 4.2. Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

Headlamps:  All bulbs used for photomet ric testing must have lower and/or upper \\nbeam filaments (if any) positioned within +/ - 0.125 mm (0.005 inch) axially, vertically \\nand horizontally of design location relative to  the lamp socket.  This specification is \\ntighter than is required by applicable regulations. \\n2. Non-Headlamps:  All replaceable, i.e.  non-sealed in lamp, bulbs must have the \\nfilaments (if any) positioned within +/- 0. 25 mm (0.010 inch) axially, vertically and \\nhorizontally of design location relative to the lamp, as specified in SAE J573d or by \\nthe bulb manufacturer.  \\nNOTE: This requirement derives fr om the FMVSS/CMVSS regulation which \\nreferences SAE J575e (Aug. 1980) (which references SAE J387). \\n \\n(b) Conditioning:  All bulbs used for photomet ric and wattage tests must be conditioned before \\nthe first use by operating at nominal design voltage for one percent of their average rated \\nlaboratory life.   \\n(c) On-Time: \\n1. Incandescent filament(s), allow a minimum of three minutes to stabilize the output of \\nthe bulb(s) prior to making maximum and minimum measurements. \\n2. Other light emitting devices, determi ne their performance characteristics in \\nrelationship to light output vs. time. Measur e and record the light output of the device \\nfor the worst case condition if significant changes in performance occur and document the duration of the on-time. \\n3. LED lighting devices, measure and reco rd the maximum output of the device \\nimmediately (within 60 sec.) after applying pow er to the device; allow internal heat \\nbuildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization time,  prior to measuring and recording individual test point data; and for the dust test, measure and record the maximum output of the device after internal heat bu ildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization \\ntime. \\nNOTE: This requirement der ives from SAE J1889 Oct93.

Use the \\nmirror on the slave fixture to reset t he horizontal zero. Mount the headlamp on \\nthe test fixture. \\nb) Adjust the vertical aim of t he \\\"VOR\\\" or \\\"VOL\\\" headlamp as follows: \\n1. Energize the low beam filament at 12.8 V DC and visually adjust the aim of \\nthe headlamp until the upper cutoff at 2 \\u00b0R is on the horizontal (0.0 \\u00b0D) for \\nVOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L is at 0.4 \\u00b0D for VOL . \\nThis aiming should be done on a test screen at least 25 feet from the lamp. \\n2. Fine tune the aim using the com puter software by scanning in  0.10 \\u00b0 \\nincrements from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to 1.5 \\u00b0 D at 2\\u00b0 R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL to \\ndetermine the point at which the maximum gradient occurs. \\nUse software or the following formula to find the maximum gradient: G=logE(a) - logE(a+0.1)           where G=gradient,  a=vetical angular position (degrees) , E(a)=candela. The maximum gradient must \\\"be not less than .13\\u2026\\\" otherwise record that the \\nCENTER GRADIENT FAILED.  \\n3. After finding the vertical location of the maximum gradient, the software/ \\noperator must set: a) the maximum gradient of VOR headlamps to be at the \\nvertical zero (0.0 \\u00b0D) of the goniometer, or b) the maximum gradient of VOL \\nheadlamps to be at 0.4D. \\n4.

Turn off all room lighting and the alignm ent laser if used to exclude extraneous light \\nfrom entering the area. \\n2. Supply power to the lower beam filam ent and adjust the voltage to the legally \\nrequired voltage (currently 12. 80 +/- .02 volts for U.S.) \\n3. Fill out any required forms and/or answer all computer entry fields. \\n4. The measurement system or test technician should locate and record the maximum \\ncandlepower reading and its location.  Posi tion the headlamp to the required test \\npositions and record the associated candlepower values for all test points  required by \\nany regulatory or other tables specified in  the test authorization, otherwise, use a \\ntable that seems appropriate.  The meas urements should use the \\u00bc reaim permitted \\nif a value exceeding the maximum is found. \\nNOTE: Where the 10U-90U area is specified  instead of a test point, the \\nmeasurement should be across the specifi ed horizontal line and up a vertical line \\nstarting on the horizontal line where the maximum intensity reading was \\nobtained.  These measurements should use the 1 degree reaim (2 degree cone) \\npermitted in Step 6 .  \\n5. Record the table number and standard,  i.e. FMVSS, CMVSS, F/CMVSS or SAE J \\nXXX and date, used as a Pass/Fail criteria on the data sheet.  Indicate whether the \\ndata  \\\"PASSED\\\" or FAILED\\\" all required acceptance criteria. \\nNOTE:  The following step, i.e. 6, must be  performed for: \\n1. all Certification tests where phot ometry evaluation is referenced, \\n2. but only for those DV tests in wh ich photometry is the only evaluation. \\nThe performance of Step 4 results in t he most upward glare region evaluation \\nbeing conducted with the commonly used interpretation, of measuring across an applicable  horizontal line and up a vertical  line at the point where the highest \\nreading on the applicable horizontal line wa s obtained.  This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6. Visually locate\\n within the region 10U to 90U - L to R any areas that are receiving \\nexcessively bright light. If such an area ex ists, scan the bright area to locate the \\napparent maximum intensity location and record the candlepower value and the position. Also record the candlepower va lue and position of all points within a 1 \\ndegree radius about the apparent maximum intensity location at 0.125 degree intervals. Find the actual highest intensity location by determining the center of the \\nhighest values obtained.  \\nActual highest intensity cd values that  are greater than 438 cd should be noted as \\nexceeding the maximum (FAIL), in addition, values exceeding 125 cd should also be \\nmarked as exceeding the maximum (FAIL), unless a 125 cd or lower value can be \\nfound within a 2 degree cone (1 degree reai m) around the actual highest intensity.  \\nNOTE:  The 2 degree cone is defined in  the rationale of  SAE J1383 JUN 90 and \\nalso in ECE R48 as the maximum area of spots of light that can exceed \\nthe maximum candlepower applied, i.e. 125 cd, to portions of the beam  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

NHTSA's Pat Boyd \\nannounced at the Fall 1997 SAE Lighting Committee meeting that the \\nrewrite of FMVSS 108 in 1998 will allow a maximum of 438 cd within a 2 \\ndegree cone for all low beam headlamps.  This was confirmed by \\nNHTSA's Rich Van Iderstine on 5/27/98 after he consulted with Pat \\nBoyd.  Therefore, this criteria can confidently be used for, at least, all \\nheadlamps that are for 1999 model vehicles or later.  \\n7.

The Product \\nEngineer must supply a pitch angle number and tolerance OR both upward and downward pitch angle numbers that he wants to certify the vehicle to.  The vehicle pitch number(s) submitted and used for testing should must be equal to or greater than the vehicle pitch number(s) of the vehicle approved fo r production.

Design voltage is the nominal voltage that t he vehicle will supply to the connector for the \\ncomponent.  North American Tail lamps are ty pically 14.0V and stop lamps are typically \\n12.8V.  However, ask the OEM to specify the nominal design voltage for the function \\nwhich could be different for the wiring, swit ching, resistors, voltage reduction modules \\netc. \\n  2. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage for 30 min, THEN run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with mi nimum requirements.   Also determine the \\nmaximum intensity location. \\n \\n3. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage and IMMEDIATELY run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with maxi mum requirements within 60 seconds, that is \\nbetween 0 and 60.49 seconds).   \\n \\n4. For lamps like CHMSLs with a maximum zone (10L to 10R and from 10U to 5D) (typically \\nalso equal to the furthest test points), test the PREDETERMINED maximum location \\nwithin the zone.  Give a 1/4 degree reaim to any test point or maximum intensity location \\nthat exceeds that maximum permitted candela.   Any test measurement which exceeds \\nthe maximum shall be remeasured at a time approaching, but not exceeding 60.49 \\nseconds, i.e. 50-60 seconds, since test meas urements taken it the earlier part of the \\nallotted 60 seconds, i.e., 0-10 or even at  10-20 seconds, may be higher than would be \\nobtained later in the allotted time period.  If multiple test points have maximums, it is \\npermitted to repeat the test at many times as  necessary to test all test points with \\nmaximums within the latter portion of the allotted time, i.e., 50-60 seconds. \\n \\n5. CHMSLs shall meet the photometric mini mums of FMVSS 108 Table 10; note the test \\npoint and zones are the same as SAEJ 1957 JUN 93, but the maximums are \\nDIFFERENT.  If the part meets only the FMVSS 108 table 10 and not either SAE J1889 \\nOct93 pr SAEJ1977 JUN 93, the function c ode marking letter(s) should be underlined on \\nthe part. \\n \\n6. In addition, locate the maximum candlepower, record the value and the location where it \\nwas obtained.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.

The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.  These bulbs are reca librated per G805-LL-C-001in accord with SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.8.3, except the annual recalibration has been replaced with a \\noperating time based calibration, which is  based on the interval recommended by the \\ncalibrating laboratory. \\n7. Note, that  there are filament or light source parameters that are not controlled in \\naccurate rated bulbs and these parameter s in \\\"some lighting devices may produce \\nsignificantly different luminous intensity measurements with two different accurate \\nrated bulbs, particularly lighting devices wi th particularly short focal lengths.\\\" SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.6). \\n8. The sensor/photometer system is desi gned and used within the guidelines for color \\nresponse, HID source use, range linearit y and sensor aperture size that are \\ncontained within SAE J1330 JUN94 sections 3. 7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3,  3.7.4 and 3.7.5.

PRODUCTION VALIDATION AND IN-PROCESS TESTS \\n  \\nA.  Certification Tests (C)\\n must be completed satisfactorily with parts from production tooling before PSW \\napproval and authorization of shipment of production part s.  If Certification tests cannot be performed with \\nparts from production tooling and production processes, PSW testing shall repeat Certification testing on \\nproduction parts with production processes. \\n \\nWhenever any change is made which could possibly aff ect part function of performance, the parts must be \\nrevalidated completely per Section III. The customer and Product Engineering must be informed that part certification could be affected.  \\n B.  PSW Tests\\n are used to demonstrate process capability and must be completed using initial production parts \\nfrom production tooling and processes prior to first produc tion shipment approval.  Tests are to continue in \\nuntil process capability is demonstrated. \\n C.   In-Process (IP) Tests\\n are used only after process capability has been established.  Tests must be completed \\nwith production parts on a continuing basis.  Sampli ng plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the \\nsignificant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan.  When the process is found to be out of control, or the test acceptance criterion are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan \\nshall be invoked. \\n  D.  Capacity Tests (CT)\\n shall be conducted to demonstrate tooling combination capability. 3 pieces in a row of \\neach lens/body cavity combination from production tooling must pass all test points on Low and High \\nBeam as indicated in the photometric criteria. \\n \\n III.

The filament lamp holder shall confor m to the characteristics given in IEC \\nPublication 61-2, third edit ion, 1969.  The holder data sheet relevant to the \\ncategory of filament lamp used, applies. \\n 5.6. Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic may be adapted for traffic on a given side of the road either by an \\nappropriate initial setting when fitted on the vehicle or by selective setting by \\nthe user. Such initial or selective setti ng may consist, for example, of fixing \\neither the optical unit at a given angle on the vehicle or the filament lamp at a \\ngiven angle in relation to the optical unit. In all cas es, only two different and \\nclearly distinct settings, one for right-h and and one for left-hand traffic, shall \\nbe possible, and the design shall pr eclude inadvertent shifting from one \\nsetting to the other or setting in an in termediate position. Where two different \\nsetting positions are provided for th e filament lamp, the components for \\nattaching the filament lamp to the re flector must be so designed and made \\n                                                \\n \\n6/  HIR1 and/or H9 filament lamps shall only be permitted to produce passing beam in \\nconjunction with the insta llation of headlamp cleani ng device(s) conforming to \\nRegulation No. 45.  In addition, with respect  to vertical inclin ation, the provision of \\nparagraph 6.2.6.2.2. of Regulation N o. 48, 01 series of amendments, shall not be applied when \\nthese lamps are installed. \\n  This restriction shall apply as long as there is no general agreement on the use of levelling \\ndevices and headlamp cleaners with respect to the level of the perfor mance of the headlamp. \\n7\\n/  A headlamp is regarded as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the filament lamp \\ncan be easily fitted into the headlamp and the pos itioning lugs can be correctly fitted into their \\nslots even in darkness.

Complementary tests shall be done acco rding to the requirements of Annex 4 \\nto ensure that in use there is no exce ssive change in photometric performance. \\n 5.8. If the lens of the headlamp is of plas tic material, tests sh all be done according \\nto the requirements of Annex 6. \\n 5.9. On headlamps designed to provide alte rnately a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, or a passing beam and/or a driv ing beam designed to become bend \\nlighting, any mechanical, el ectromechanical or other device incorporated in \\nthe headlamp for these purposes shall be so constructed that: \\n 5.9.1. the device is strong enough to with stand 50,000 operations without suffering \\ndamage despite the vibrations to whic h it may be subjected in normal use; \\n 5.9.2. in the case of failure the illumination above the line H-H shall not exceed the \\nvalues of a passing beam according to paragraph 6.2.5.; in addition, on headlamps designed to provide a passing and/or a driving beam to become a \\nbend lighting, a minimum illumination of at least 5 lux shall be fulfilled in test point 25 V (VV line, D 75 cm). \\n 5.9.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without \\nany possibility of the mechanis m stopping in between two positions; \\n 5.9.4. the user cannot, with ordi nary tools, change the shape or position of the \\nmoving parts. \\n 6. ILLUMINATION  6.1. General provisions\\n \\n 6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that th ey give adequate illumination without \\ndazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting the driving beam. \\n 6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of \\na vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its \\naxes as shown in Annex 3 to this Regulation. \\n 6.1.3. The headlamps shall be checked by mean s of an uncoloured standard (\\u00e9talon) \\nfilament lamp designed for a rated volta ge of 12 V.  During the checking of  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 15   \\n \\n the headlamp, the voltage at the terminals of the filament lamp shall be \\nregulated so as to obtain the refere nce luminous flux as indicated at the \\nrelevant data sheet of Regulation No. 37. \\n 6.1.4. The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of \\nthis paragraph 6 with at least one sta ndard (\\u00e9talon) filament lamp, which may \\nbe submitted with the headlamp. \\n 6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:  6.2.2.1. in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand \\ntraffic, the \\\"cut-off\\\" on the left-half of the screen 8\\n/ is horizontal and, in the \\ncase of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left -hand traffic, the \\n\\\"cut-off\\\" on the right-half of the screen is horizontal; \\n 6.2.2.2. this horizontal part of the \\\"cut-off\\\" is  situated on the sc reen 25 cm below the \\nlevel hh (see Annex 3);  \\n \\n6.2.2.3. the \\\"elbow\\\" of the \\\"c ut-off\\\" is on line vv. 9\\n/ \\n 6.2.3. When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely for \\nprovision of a passing beam, 10\\n/ comply only with the requirements set out in  \\n                                                 \\n8/  The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the \\\"cut-off\\\" over a range of \\nat least 5\\u00b0 on either side of the line vv. \\n \\n9/  If the beam does not have a cut-off with a clear \\\"elbow\\\", the lateral adjustment shall be \\neffected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for illumination at points 75 R and \\n50 R for right-hand traffic and for points  75 L and 50 L for left-hand traffic. \\n 10\\n/  Such a special \\\"passing beam\\\" headlamp ma y incorporate a driving beam not subject to \\nrequirements.

Where a headlamp so aimed does not meet the requirements set out in \\nparagraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and 6.3., its alignment may be changed, provided that the axis of the beam is not displ aced laterally by more than 1\\u00b0 (= 44 cm) \\nto the right or left. 11\\n/ To facilitate alignment by means of the \\\"cut-off\\\", the \\nheadlamp may be partially occulted in order to sharpen the \\\"cut-off\\\". \\n 6.2.5. The illumination produced on the screen by the passing beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements: \\n \\n6.2.6. There shall be no lateral va riations detrimental to good visibility in any of the \\nzones I, II, III and IV. \\n 6.2.7.

In the case of a headlamp designed to  provide a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, measurements of the illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall be taken with the same headlamp alignment as for measurements under paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. above; in the case of a \\nheadlamp providing a driving beam only, it shall be so adjusted that the area \\nof maximum illumination is centred on th e point of intersection of lines hh \\nand vv; such a headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in \\nparagraph 6.3. \\n 6.3.2. It is possible to use several light sources for the driving beam.  6.3.3. The illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements. \\n 6.3.3.1. The point of intersection (HV) of lines hh and vv shall be si tuated within the \\nisolux 80 per cent of maximum illumination. This maximum value (E\\nM) shall \\nnot be less than 32 lux for Class A headlamps and 48 lux for Class B \\nheadlamps.  The maximum value shall in no circumstances exceed 240 lux; in \\naddition, in the case of a combined passing and driving headlamp, this \\nmaximum value shall not be more than  16 times the illumination measured for \\nthe passing beam at point 75 R (or 75 L). \\n 6.3.3.1.1. The maximum intensity (I\\nM) of the driving beam e xpressed in thousands of \\ncandelas shall be calculated by the formula: \\n  I\\nM = 0.625 E M \\n 6.3.3.1.2. The reference mark (I\\n'\\nM) of this maximum intensity, referred to in \\nparagraph 4.2.2.7. above, shall be obtained by the ratio: \\n \\n  \\n \\n I'I\\n30.208  EMM\\nM == E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 19   \\n \\n This value shall be rounded off to the value 7.5 - 10 - 12.5 - 17.5 - 20 - 25 - \\n27.5 - 30 - 37.5 - 40 - 45 - 50. \\n 6.3.3.2. Starting from point HV, horizontally to  the right and left, the illumination \\nshall be not less than 16 lux for Cl ass A headlamp and 24 lux for Class B \\nheadlamp up to a distance of 1.125 m a nd not less than 4 lux for Class A \\nheadlamp and 6 lux for Class B h eadlamp up to a di stance of 2.25 m. \\n 6.4. In the case of headlamps with adju stable reflector the requirements of \\nparagraphs 6.2. and 6.3. are applicable for each mounting position indicated according to paragraph 2.1.3.  For verifi cation the following procedure shall \\nbe used: \\n 6.4.1. Each applied position is realized on the test goniometer with respect to a line \\njoining the centre of the light source  and point HV on a aiming screen.  The \\nadjustable reflector is then moved into such a position that the light pattern on \\nthe screen corresponds to the aiming pr escriptions of paragraphs 6.2.1. to \\n6.2.2.3. and/or 6.3.1; \\n 6.4.2. with the reflector initially fixed acco rding to paragraph 6.4.1., the headlamp \\nmust meet the relevant photometric re quirements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3; \\n \\n6.4.3. additional tests are made after the reflector has been moved vertically \\u00b1 2\\u00b0 or \\nat least into the maximum position, if less than 2\\u00b0, from its initial position by \\nmeans of the headlamps adjusting device. Having re-aimed the headlamp as a whole (by means of the goniometer fo r example) in the corresponding \\nopposite direction the light output in the following directions shall be \\ncontrolled and lie within the required limits: \\n \\npassing beam : points HV and 75 R (75 L respectively); driving beam : E\\nM and point HV (percentage of E M). \\n \\n6.4.4. if the applicant has not indicated more than one mounting position,  the \\nprocedure of paragraphs 6.4.1. to 6.4.3. shall be repeated for all other \\npositions; \\n 6.4.5. if the applicant has no t asked for special mounti ng positions, the headlamp \\nshall be aimed for measurements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3. with the \\nheadlamps adjusting device in its m ean position.  The additional test of \\nparagraph 6.4.3. shall be made with the reflector moved into its extreme positions (instead of \\n+ 2\\u00b0) by means of the headlamps adjusting device. \\n 6.5. The screen illumination values mentioned in paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and \\n6.3. above shall be measured by means of a photo receptor, the effective area of which shall be contained within a square of 65 mm side.

TESTING TO ECE REGULATIONS AND OT HER NON-U.S. OR CANADIAN REGULATIONS   \\nTesting to ECE European regulations and other NON- U.S. OR CANADIAN regulations is generally \\nperformed to the specific instructions included within  the regulation.  Applicable ECE regulations are \\nlisted in Section 10 REFERENCES.  Testing for ot her markets should be performed according to their \\nspecific regulations which should be obt ained from WISE or from the customer. \\nWhen interpretations are required Test Technicians  or Test Engineers should consult the Regulatory \\nCompliance Engineer so that any interpretations  can have both a consensus and legal basis.  The \\nRegulatory Compliance Engineer should ensure that in terpretations are recorded for future use.  \\nInterpretations that are deemed significant will be incorporated in revisions to this document  \\nNOTE:  Sections 5, 6 and 7 as written specifica lly to cover the U.S./Canadian legal requirements. \\nOther sections are applicable to foreign requirem ents, except where foreign requirements impose \\neither contradictory or additional requirements.

REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING \\nNOTE: Refer to the test requirements of sect ions 4.1 and 4.1.4 of SAEJ1383 (APR85) for sample \\npreparation for applicable headlamp tests. \\n4.1  Sample Identification and Documentation \\n(a) The design responsible engineer for each part tested must sign a statement that must be \\nincluded in the test engineer's part certification report  that the parts and fixtures supplied for \\ntest are representative of the latest desi gn level approved for production, the device has been \\nmounted on the fixture in vehicle position us ing nominal design torque, and the device is \\napproved for testing. \\nNOTE: Not required for development,  non-certific ation DV tests, or in-process testing. \\n(b) For a headlamp used as a daytime running lamp , whether the lamp is exposed or concealed, \\ninclude the filament reduced voltage value, or, fo r a system that uses a DRL Module, provide \\na nominal module and part number. \\n(c) All parts being tested and related parts, i.e. sockets, which affect test results, must be \\nidentified by part number, including suffix, in the part drawing. Any deviation of test parts from \\nthose specified in the drawing must be documented by the design responsible engineer.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.  Issued:  6/24/98   Revised:  08/31/00   Revision Level 4.0 \\nCONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 80 11/4/2011 4.2. Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

The meas urements should use the \\u00bc reaim permitted \\nif a value exceeding the maximum is found. \\nNOTE: Where the 10U-90U area is specified  instead of a test point, the \\nmeasurement should be across the specifi ed horizontal line and up a vertical line \\nstarting on the horizontal line where the maximum intensity reading was \\nobtained.  These measurements should use the 1 degree reaim (2 degree cone) \\npermitted in Step 6 .  \\n5.

This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6. Visually locate\\n within the region 10U to 90U - L to R any areas that are receiving \\nexcessively bright light.

Also record the candlepower va lue and position of all points within a 1 \\ndegree radius about the apparent maximum intensity location at 0.125 degree intervals. Find the actual highest intensity location by determining the center of the \\nhighest values obtained.  \\nActual highest intensity cd values that  are greater than 438 cd should be noted as \\nexceeding the maximum (FAIL), in addition, values exceeding 125 cd should also be \\nmarked as exceeding the maximum (FAIL), unless a 125 cd or lower value can be \\nfound within a 2 degree cone (1 degree reai m) around the actual highest intensity.  \\nNOTE:  The 2 degree cone is defined in  the rationale of  SAE J1383 JUN 90 and \\nalso in ECE R48 as the maximum area of spots of light that can exceed \\nthe maximum candlepower applied, i.e. 125 cd, to portions of the beam  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

Design voltage is the nominal voltage that t he vehicle will supply to the connector for the \\ncomponent.  North American Tail lamps are ty pically 14.0V and stop lamps are typically \\n12.8V.  However, ask the OEM to specify the nominal design voltage for the function \\nwhich could be different for the wiring, swit ching, resistors, voltage reduction modules \\netc. \\n  2. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage for 30 min, THEN run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with mi nimum requirements.   Also determine the \\nmaximum intensity location. \\n \\n3. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage and IMMEDIATELY run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with maxi mum requirements within 60 seconds, that is \\nbetween 0 and 60.49 seconds).   \\n \\n4. For lamps like CHMSLs with a maximum zone (10L to 10R and from 10U to 5D) (typically \\nalso equal to the furthest test points), test the PREDETERMINED maximum location \\nwithin the zone.  Give a 1/4 degree reaim to any test point or maximum intensity location \\nthat exceeds that maximum permitted candela.   Any test measurement which exceeds \\nthe maximum shall be remeasured at a time approaching, but not exceeding 60.49 \\nseconds, i.e. 50-60 seconds, since test meas urements taken it the earlier part of the \\nallotted 60 seconds, i.e., 0-10 or even at  10-20 seconds, may be higher than would be \\nobtained later in the allotted time period.  If multiple test points have maximums, it is \\npermitted to repeat the test at many times as  necessary to test all test points with \\nmaximums within the latter portion of the allotted time, i.e., 50-60 seconds. \\n \\n5.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.

The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.

GENERAL  PURPOSE - to define the functional and environmental requirements necessary to confirm part functionality and durability and to describe the test methods necessary to evaluate these requirements. \\n This exterior lamp engineering specification is a supplem ent to the released drawing and all requirements herein \\nmust be met in addition to those specifically detailed on the part drawing.  This specification pertains to components which must be designed to comply with FMVSS/CMVSS 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment:  \\na.  Replaceable bulb headlamp assemblies\\n. \\nThe replaceable bulb headlamp consists of a lens, hous ing, reflector, replaceable light source, light source \\nretaining ring/cap, and attaching hardware.  Its function is to provide forward vehicle illumination.  The headlamp must be designed to comply with FMVSS/CMVSS 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment. \\n B.  All exterior lamp and reflex reflector assemblies.\\n \\nA signal and/or marking lamp consis ts of a lens, housing, reflector, re placeable light source, and attaching \\nhardware and may include a reflex re flector.  A reflex reflector may be its own molded piece of plastic and \\nits attaching hardware.  These components function  to  provide signaling and/or marking either by a light \\nsource or reflected light.. \\n Submission of an acceptable CONTROL PLAN is the responsibility of the manufacturing source.  The \\nmanufacturing source will retain the orig inal of the approved Control Plan a nd any later revisions per QS 9000 and \\nprovide a copy to the design responsible activity which must  approve the control plan prior to PSW approval.  The \\nengineering test program outlined by th e control plan is intended as a suppl ement to normal material inspections, \\ndimensional checking and in-process controls.

PRODUCTION VALIDATION AND IN-PROCESS TESTS \\n  \\nA.  Certification Tests (C)\\n must be completed satisfactorily with parts from production tooling before PSW \\napproval and authorization of shipment of production part s.  If Certification tests cannot be performed with \\nparts from production tooling and production processes, PSW testing shall repeat Certification testing on \\nproduction parts with production processes. \\n \\nWhenever any change is made which could possibly aff ect part function of performance, the parts must be \\nrevalidated completely per Section III. The customer and Product Engineering must be informed that part certification could be affected.  \\n B.  PSW Tests\\n are used to demonstrate process capability and must be completed using initial production parts \\nfrom production tooling and processes prior to first produc tion shipment approval.  Tests are to continue in \\nuntil process capability is demonstrated. \\n C.   In-Process (IP) Tests\\n are used only after process capability has been established.  Tests must be completed \\nwith production parts on a continuing basis.  Sampli ng plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the \\nsignificant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan.  When the process is found to be out of control, or the test acceptance criterion are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan \\nshall be invoked. \\n  D.  Capacity Tests (CT)\\n shall be conducted to demonstrate tooling combination capability. 3 pieces in a row of \\neach lens/body cavity combination from production tooling must pass all test points on Low and High \\nBeam as indicated in the photometric criteria. \\n \\n III.

GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS \\n \\n5.1. Each sample shall conform to the specifi cations set forth in paragraphs 6 to 8 \\nbelow. \\n 5.2. Headlamps shall be so made as to  retain their prescribed photometric \\ncharacteristics and to remain in good working order when in normal use, in spite of the vibrations to which they may be subjected. \\n 5.2.1. Headlamps shall be fitted with a device enabling them to be so adjusted on the \\nvehicles as to comply with the rules applicable to them.  Such a device need not be fitted on units in wh ich the reflector and the diffusing lens cannot be \\nseparated, provided the use of such units is confined to vehicles on which the \\nheadlamp setting can be adjusted by other means.  \\n \\n                                                \\n \\n5/  Technical requirements for fila ment lamps: see Regulation No. 37.

However, these provisions shall not apply to headlamp assemblies whose \\nreflectors are indivisible. For this t ype of assembly the requirements of \\nparagraph 6.3. of this Regulation apply. \\n 5.3. The headlamp shall be equipped with filament lamp(s) approved according to \\nRegulation No. 37.  Any Regulation N o. 37 filament lamp may be used, \\nprovided that no restriction on the applica tion is made in the table of contents \\nof Regulation No. 37. 6\\n/ \\n 5.4. The components by which a filament lamp is fixed to the reflector shall be so \\nmade that, even in darkness, the filament lamp can be fixed in no position but the correct one. 7\\n/ \\n 5.5. The filament lamp holder shall confor m to the characteristics given in IEC \\nPublication 61-2, third edit ion, 1969.  The holder data sheet relevant to the \\ncategory of filament lamp used, applies. \\n 5.6. Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic may be adapted for traffic on a given side of the road either by an \\nappropriate initial setting when fitted on the vehicle or by selective setting by \\nthe user. Such initial or selective setti ng may consist, for example, of fixing \\neither the optical unit at a given angle on the vehicle or the filament lamp at a \\ngiven angle in relation to the optical unit. In all cas es, only two different and \\nclearly distinct settings, one for right-h and and one for left-hand traffic, shall \\nbe possible, and the design shall pr eclude inadvertent shifting from one \\nsetting to the other or setting in an in termediate position. Where two different \\nsetting positions are provided for th e filament lamp, the components for \\nattaching the filament lamp to the re flector must be so designed and made \\n                                                \\n \\n6/  HIR1 and/or H9 filament lamps shall only be permitted to produce passing beam in \\nconjunction with the insta llation of headlamp cleani ng device(s) conforming to \\nRegulation No. 45.  In addition, with respect  to vertical inclin ation, the provision of \\nparagraph 6.2.6.2.2. of Regulation N o. 48, 01 series of amendments, shall not be applied when \\nthese lamps are installed. \\n  This restriction shall apply as long as there is no general agreement on the use of levelling \\ndevices and headlamp cleaners with respect to the level of the perfor mance of the headlamp. \\n7\\n/  A headlamp is regarded as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the filament lamp \\ncan be easily fitted into the headlamp and the pos itioning lugs can be correctly fitted into their \\nslots even in darkness.

Complementary tests shall be done acco rding to the requirements of Annex 4 \\nto ensure that in use there is no exce ssive change in photometric performance. \\n 5.8. If the lens of the headlamp is of plas tic material, tests sh all be done according \\nto the requirements of Annex 6. \\n 5.9. On headlamps designed to provide alte rnately a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, or a passing beam and/or a driv ing beam designed to become bend \\nlighting, any mechanical, el ectromechanical or other device incorporated in \\nthe headlamp for these purposes shall be so constructed that: \\n 5.9.1. the device is strong enough to with stand 50,000 operations without suffering \\ndamage despite the vibrations to whic h it may be subjected in normal use; \\n 5.9.2. in the case of failure the illumination above the line H-H shall not exceed the \\nvalues of a passing beam according to paragraph 6.2.5.; in addition, on headlamps designed to provide a passing and/or a driving beam to become a \\nbend lighting, a minimum illumination of at least 5 lux shall be fulfilled in test point 25 V (VV line, D 75 cm). \\n 5.9.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without \\nany possibility of the mechanis m stopping in between two positions; \\n 5.9.4. the user cannot, with ordi nary tools, change the shape or position of the \\nmoving parts. \\n 6. ILLUMINATION  6.1. General provisions\\n \\n 6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that th ey give adequate illumination without \\ndazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting the driving beam. \\n 6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of \\na vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its \\naxes as shown in Annex 3 to this Regulation. \\n 6.1.3. The headlamps shall be checked by mean s of an uncoloured standard (\\u00e9talon) \\nfilament lamp designed for a rated volta ge of 12 V.  During the checking of  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 15   \\n \\n the headlamp, the voltage at the terminals of the filament lamp shall be \\nregulated so as to obtain the refere nce luminous flux as indicated at the \\nrelevant data sheet of Regulation No. 37. \\n 6.1.4. The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of \\nthis paragraph 6 with at least one sta ndard (\\u00e9talon) filament lamp, which may \\nbe submitted with the headlamp. \\n 6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:  6.2.2.1. in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand \\ntraffic, the \\\"cut-off\\\" on the left-half of the screen 8\\n/ is horizontal and, in the \\ncase of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left -hand traffic, the \\n\\\"cut-off\\\" on the right-half of the screen is horizontal; \\n 6.2.2.2. this horizontal part of the \\\"cut-off\\\" is  situated on the sc reen 25 cm below the \\nlevel hh (see Annex 3);  \\n \\n6.2.2.3. the \\\"elbow\\\" of the \\\"c ut-off\\\" is on line vv. 9\\n/ \\n 6.2.3. When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely for \\nprovision of a passing beam, 10\\n/ comply only with the requirements set out in  \\n                                                 \\n8/  The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the \\\"cut-off\\\" over a range of \\nat least 5\\u00b0 on either side of the line vv. \\n \\n9/  If the beam does not have a cut-off with a clear \\\"elbow\\\", the lateral adjustment shall be \\neffected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for illumination at points 75 R and \\n50 R for right-hand traffic and for points  75 L and 50 L for left-hand traffic. \\n 10\\n/  Such a special \\\"passing beam\\\" headlamp ma y incorporate a driving beam not subject to \\nrequirements.

Where a headlamp so aimed does not meet the requirements set out in \\nparagraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and 6.3., its alignment may be changed, provided that the axis of the beam is not displ aced laterally by more than 1\\u00b0 (= 44 cm) \\nto the right or left. 11\\n/ To facilitate alignment by means of the \\\"cut-off\\\", the \\nheadlamp may be partially occulted in order to sharpen the \\\"cut-off\\\". \\n 6.2.5. The illumination produced on the screen by the passing beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements: \\n \\n6.2.6. There shall be no lateral va riations detrimental to good visibility in any of the \\nzones I, II, III and IV. \\n 6.2.7. The illumination values in zones \\\"A\\\" and \\\"B\\\" as shown in figure C in \\nAnnex 3 shall be checked by the measur ement of the photometric values of \\n                                                \\n \\n11/  The limit of realignment of 1\\u00b0 towards the right  or left is not incompatible with upward or \\ndownward vertical realig nment.  The latter is limited only by the requirements of paragraph 6.3. \\nHowever, the horizontal part of the \\\"cut -off\\\" should not extend beyond the line hh \\n(the provisions of paragra ph 6.3. are not applicable to h eadlamps intended to meet the \\nrequirements of this Regulation only for provision of a passing beam).

The requirements in paragraph 6.2.5. above shall also ap ply to headlamps \\ndesigned to provide bend lighting and/or  that include the additional light \\nsource referred to in paragraph 6.2.10.2. \\n 6.2.9.1. If bend lighting is obtained by:  6.2.9.1.1. swivelling the passing beam or moving horizontally the kink  of the elbow of \\nthe cut-off, the measurements shall be carried out after the complete \\nheadlamp assembly has been reai med horizontally, e.g. by means of a \\ngoniometer; \\n 6.2.9.1.2. moving one or more optical parts of the headlamp without moving \\nhorizontally the kink of the elbow of the cut-off, measurements shall be \\ncarried out with these parts being in their extreme operating position; \\n \\n6.2.9.1.3. means of one additional light source without moving horizontally the kink of \\nthe elbow of the cut-off, measurements shall be carried out with this light \\nsource activated. \\n 6.2.10. Only one principal light source is pe rmitted for each passing beam headlamp.  \\nHowever, a maximum of two additional light sources are permitted as follows: \\n 6.2.10.1. One additional light source inside the passing beam headlamp according to \\nRegulation No. 37 may be used to  contribute to  bend lighting. \\n \\n                                                \\n \\n12/  Illumination values in any point of zones A a nd B, which also lies within zone III, shall not \\nexceed 0.7 lux.

One additional light source according to Regulation No. 37, inside the passing \\nbeam headlamp, may be used for the purposes of generating infrared radiation.  It shall only be activated at  the same time as the principal light \\nsource.  In the event that the principal light source fails, this additional light source shall be automatically switched off. \\n 6.2.10.3. In the event of failure of an addi tional light source, the headlamp shall \\ncontinue to fulfil the requirements of the passing beam. \\n 6.3. Provisions concerning driving beams\\n \\n 6.3.1. In the case of a headlamp designed to  provide a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, measurements of the illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall be taken with the same headlamp alignment as for measurements under paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. above; in the case of a \\nheadlamp providing a driving beam only, it shall be so adjusted that the area \\nof maximum illumination is centred on th e point of intersection of lines hh \\nand vv; such a headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in \\nparagraph 6.3. \\n 6.3.2. It is possible to use several light sources for the driving beam.  6.3.3. The illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements. \\n 6.3.3.1. The point of intersection (HV) of lines hh and vv shall be si tuated within the \\nisolux 80 per cent of maximum illumination. This maximum value (E\\nM) shall \\nnot be less than 32 lux for Class A headlamps and 48 lux for Class B \\nheadlamps.  The maximum value shall in no circumstances exceed 240 lux; in \\naddition, in the case of a combined passing and driving headlamp, this \\nmaximum value shall not be more than  16 times the illumination measured for \\nthe passing beam at point 75 R (or 75 L). \\n 6.3.3.1.1. The maximum intensity (I\\nM) of the driving beam e xpressed in thousands of \\ncandelas shall be calculated by the formula: \\n  I\\nM = 0.625 E M \\n 6.3.3.1.2. The reference mark (I\\n'\\nM) of this maximum intensity, referred to in \\nparagraph 4.2.2.7. above, shall be obtained by the ratio: \\n \\n  \\n \\n I'I\\n30.208  EMM\\nM == E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 19   \\n \\n This value shall be rounded off to the value 7.5 - 10 - 12.5 - 17.5 - 20 - 25 - \\n27.5 - 30 - 37.5 - 40 - 45 - 50. \\n 6.3.3.2.

In the case of headlamps with adju stable reflector the requirements of \\nparagraphs 6.2. and 6.3. are applicable for each mounting position indicated according to paragraph 2.1.3.  For verifi cation the following procedure shall \\nbe used: \\n 6.4.1. Each applied position is realized on the test goniometer with respect to a line \\njoining the centre of the light source  and point HV on a aiming screen.  The \\nadjustable reflector is then moved into such a position that the light pattern on \\nthe screen corresponds to the aiming pr escriptions of paragraphs 6.2.1. to \\n6.2.2.3. and/or 6.3.1; \\n 6.4.2. with the reflector initially fixed acco rding to paragraph 6.4.1., the headlamp \\nmust meet the relevant photometric re quirements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3; \\n \\n6.4.3. additional tests are made after the reflector has been moved vertically \\u00b1 2\\u00b0 or \\nat least into the maximum position, if less than 2\\u00b0, from its initial position by \\nmeans of the headlamps adjusting device. Having re-aimed the headlamp as a whole (by means of the goniometer fo r example) in the corresponding \\nopposite direction the light output in the following directions shall be \\ncontrolled and lie within the required limits: \\n \\npassing beam : points HV and 75 R (75 L respectively); driving beam : E\\nM and point HV (percentage of E M). \\n \\n6.4.4. if the applicant has not indicated more than one mounting position,  the \\nprocedure of paragraphs 6.4.1. to 6.4.3. shall be repeated for all other \\npositions; \\n 6.4.5. if the applicant has no t asked for special mounti ng positions, the headlamp \\nshall be aimed for measurements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3. with the \\nheadlamps adjusting device in its m ean position.  The additional test of \\nparagraph 6.4.3. shall be made with the reflector moved into its extreme positions (instead of \\n+ 2\\u00b0) by means of the headlamps adjusting device. \\n 6.5. The screen illumination values mentioned in paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and \\n6.3. above shall be measured by means of a photo receptor, the effective area of which shall be contained within a square of 65 mm side.

REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING \\nNOTE: Refer to the test requirements of sect ions 4.1 and 4.1.4 of SAEJ1383 (APR85) for sample \\npreparation for applicable headlamp tests. \\n4.1  Sample Identification and Documentation \\n(a) The design responsible engineer for each part tested must sign a statement that must be \\nincluded in the test engineer's part certification report  that the parts and fixtures supplied for \\ntest are representative of the latest desi gn level approved for production, the device has been \\nmounted on the fixture in vehicle position us ing nominal design torque, and the device is \\napproved for testing. \\nNOTE: Not required for development,  non-certific ation DV tests, or in-process testing. \\n(b) For a headlamp used as a daytime running lamp , whether the lamp is exposed or concealed, \\ninclude the filament reduced voltage value, or, fo r a system that uses a DRL Module, provide \\na nominal module and part number. \\n(c) All parts being tested and related parts, i.e. sockets, which affect test results, must be \\nidentified by part number, including suffix, in the part drawing. Any deviation of test parts from \\nthose specified in the drawing must be documented by the design responsible engineer.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

Headlamps:  All bulbs used for photomet ric testing must have lower and/or upper \\nbeam filaments (if any) positioned within +/ - 0.125 mm (0.005 inch) axially, vertically \\nand horizontally of design location relative to  the lamp socket.  This specification is \\ntighter than is required by applicable regulations. \\n2. Non-Headlamps:  All replaceable, i.e.  non-sealed in lamp, bulbs must have the \\nfilaments (if any) positioned within +/- 0. 25 mm (0.010 inch) axially, vertically and \\nhorizontally of design location relative to the lamp, as specified in SAE J573d or by \\nthe bulb manufacturer.  \\nNOTE: This requirement derives fr om the FMVSS/CMVSS regulation which \\nreferences SAE J575e (Aug. 1980) (which references SAE J387). \\n \\n(b) Conditioning:  All bulbs used for photomet ric and wattage tests must be conditioned before \\nthe first use by operating at nominal design voltage for one percent of their average rated \\nlaboratory life.   \\n(c) On-Time: \\n1. Incandescent filament(s), allow a minimum of three minutes to stabilize the output of \\nthe bulb(s) prior to making maximum and minimum measurements. \\n2. Other light emitting devices, determi ne their performance characteristics in \\nrelationship to light output vs. time. Measur e and record the light output of the device \\nfor the worst case condition if significant changes in performance occur and document the duration of the on-time. \\n3. LED lighting devices, measure and reco rd the maximum output of the device \\nimmediately (within 60 sec.) after applying pow er to the device; allow internal heat \\nbuildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization time,  prior to measuring and recording individual test point data; and for the dust test, measure and record the maximum output of the device after internal heat bu ildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization \\ntime. \\nNOTE: This requirement der ives from SAE J1889 Oct93.

The \\n1/4 degree re-aim (tolerance of 0.25 degrees) is  considered to mean within a cone with a \\n1/4 degree radius . \\n5.1.1. Low-Beam Photometry \\n(a) Mount the alignment test fixture on the loca ting pins of the goniometer, with the low beam \\nfocal point at the center.  Adjust the height  of the goniometer so that the sample\\u2019s \\nmechanical axis is the same height as the photodetector. \\n(b) Rotate the goniometer to the aiming plane position. (c) Aim the Low Beam using the appropriate headlamp aim system from (c) 1), 2),  3) or 4)  \\n1.

Use the \\nmirror on the slave fixture to reset t he horizontal zero. Mount the headlamp on \\nthe test fixture. \\nb) Adjust the vertical aim of t he \\\"VOR\\\" or \\\"VOL\\\" headlamp as follows: \\n1. Energize the low beam filament at 12.8 V DC and visually adjust the aim of \\nthe headlamp until the upper cutoff at 2 \\u00b0R is on the horizontal (0.0 \\u00b0D) for \\nVOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L is at 0.4 \\u00b0D for VOL . \\nThis aiming should be done on a test screen at least 25 feet from the lamp. \\n2. Fine tune the aim using the com puter software by scanning in  0.10 \\u00b0 \\nincrements from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to 1.5 \\u00b0 D at 2\\u00b0 R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL to \\ndetermine the point at which the maximum gradient occurs. \\nUse software or the following formula to find the maximum gradient: G=logE(a) - logE(a+0.1)           where G=gradient,  a=vetical angular position (degrees) , E(a)=candela. The maximum gradient must \\\"be not less than .13\\u2026\\\" otherwise record that the \\nCENTER GRADIENT FAILED.  \\n3. After finding the vertical location of the maximum gradient, the software/ \\noperator must set: a) the maximum gradient of VOR headlamps to be at the \\nvertical zero (0.0 \\u00b0D) of the goniometer, or b) the maximum gradient of VOL \\nheadlamps to be at 0.4D. \\n4. Scan in  0.10 \\u00b0 increments from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to1.5\\u00b0 D at the locations: 1 \\u00b0R and 3\\u00b0R \\nfor VOR (i.e., the ends of minimum width) and 1.5\\u00b0L and 3.5 \\u00b0L for VOL (i.e., \\nthe ends of minimum width) to determine the maximum gradients (or \\ninclinations) at these locations.  \\n5. If  the maximum gradients measured at : 1\\u00b0R and 3\\u00b0R for VOR and 1.5 \\u00b0L and \\n3.5\\u00b0L for VOL are not vertically within +/- 0.2 \\u00b0of the maximum gradients  at: \\n2\\u00b0R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL,  record that the END GRADIENT FAILED AT \\nand specify the horizontal angle . \\n6. If the gradients at the ends of the mi nimum width are within the required +/- \\n0.2, then Go to step 5.1.1.(d) Low beam Measurement.  \\nNOTE: In the future multiple light sources may be permitted, if they are \\nlegal and required by a particular design and some sources are independently adjustable in relation to the first, repeat the previous steps for the additional independently aimable light sources. \\n4.

Fill out any required forms and/or answer all computer entry fields. \\n4. The measurement system or test technician should locate and record the maximum \\ncandlepower reading and its location.  Posi tion the headlamp to the required test \\npositions and record the associated candlepower values for all test points  required by \\nany regulatory or other tables specified in  the test authorization, otherwise, use a \\ntable that seems appropriate.  The meas urements should use the \\u00bc reaim permitted \\nif a value exceeding the maximum is found. \\nNOTE: Where the 10U-90U area is specified  instead of a test point, the \\nmeasurement should be across the specifi ed horizontal line and up a vertical line \\nstarting on the horizontal line where the maximum intensity reading was \\nobtained.  These measurements should use the 1 degree reaim (2 degree cone) \\npermitted in Step 6 .  \\n5. Record the table number and standard,  i.e. FMVSS, CMVSS, F/CMVSS or SAE J \\nXXX and date, used as a Pass/Fail criteria on the data sheet.  Indicate whether the \\ndata  \\\"PASSED\\\" or FAILED\\\" all required acceptance criteria. \\nNOTE:  The following step, i.e. 6, must be  performed for: \\n1. all Certification tests where phot ometry evaluation is referenced, \\n2. but only for those DV tests in wh ich photometry is the only evaluation. \\nThe performance of Step 4 results in t he most upward glare region evaluation \\nbeing conducted with the commonly used interpretation, of measuring across an applicable  horizontal line and up a vertical  line at the point where the highest \\nreading on the applicable horizontal line wa s obtained.  This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6. Visually locate\\n within the region 10U to 90U - L to R any areas that are receiving \\nexcessively bright light. If such an area ex ists, scan the bright area to locate the \\napparent maximum intensity location and record the candlepower value and the position. Also record the candlepower va lue and position of all points within a 1 \\ndegree radius about the apparent maximum intensity location at 0.125 degree intervals. Find the actual highest intensity location by determining the center of the \\nhighest values obtained.  \\nActual highest intensity cd values that  are greater than 438 cd should be noted as \\nexceeding the maximum (FAIL), in addition, values exceeding 125 cd should also be \\nmarked as exceeding the maximum (FAIL), unless a 125 cd or lower value can be \\nfound within a 2 degree cone (1 degree reai m) around the actual highest intensity.  \\nNOTE:  The 2 degree cone is defined in  the rationale of  SAE J1383 JUN 90 and \\nalso in ECE R48 as the maximum area of spots of light that can exceed \\nthe maximum candlepower applied, i.e. 125 cd, to portions of the beam  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

Therefore, this criteria can confidently be used for, at least, all \\nheadlamps that are for 1999 model vehicles or later.  \\n7. For light sources other than incandescent light sources, measure and record the time \\n(in 0.1 seconds) to achieve nominal full brightness by energizing the bulb after the \\nlight source has fully cooled or has been o ff for a minimum of 30 minutes, whichever \\nis greater. \\n8. For headlamps which are aimed by moving the reflector relative to the lens and \\nheadlamp housing, or vice versa, or by aimi ng an internal lamp assembly relative to \\nthe external lens, repeat steps 5.1.1 (a) & (b) and ( c) 1) through 3) as appropriate \\nand 5.1.1(d) (1) through (5) at, 4U-V, 4D-V, and H-2.5L, and  H-2.5R.  At the test \\npositions, offset the goniometer to t he corresponding changes in aim position. \\nNOTE: IF the reflector moves relative to the lens and housing OR vice versa  \\nAND the headlamp is a Visual/Optical headlamp,  the headlamp may \\nbe photometered to the full range of vehicle pitch in the upward and \\ndownward directions, instead of at 4U-V, 4D-V .  The Product \\nEngineer must supply a pitch angle number and tolerance OR both upward and downward pitch angle numbers that he wants to certify the vehicle to.  The vehicle pitch number(s) submitted and used for testing should must be equal to or greater than the vehicle pitch number(s) of the vehicle approved fo r production.  A Visual/Optical \\nheadlamp must pass photometry at the full range of vehicle pitch .  \\nNOTE: Maximum variations of static vehicle pitch  (ref. FMVSS 108 S.7.8.3) \\nare to be obtained from the program engineering ride height information, but at this time only apply to: 1) to the maximum vertical \\nangles to which photometry must  comply for visual/optical \\nheadlamps. AND 2) the required maximum vertical adjustment angle in the laboratory for fixed lens/moveable reflector headlamps\\n. \\n(E) ECE Low Beam Measurement  \\n1.

Design voltage is the nominal voltage that t he vehicle will supply to the connector for the \\ncomponent.  North American Tail lamps are ty pically 14.0V and stop lamps are typically \\n12.8V.  However, ask the OEM to specify the nominal design voltage for the function \\nwhich could be different for the wiring, swit ching, resistors, voltage reduction modules \\netc. \\n  2. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage for 30 min, THEN run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with mi nimum requirements.   Also determine the \\nmaximum intensity location. \\n \\n3. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage and IMMEDIATELY run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with maxi mum requirements within 60 seconds, that is \\nbetween 0 and 60.49 seconds).   \\n \\n4. For lamps like CHMSLs with a maximum zone (10L to 10R and from 10U to 5D) (typically \\nalso equal to the furthest test points), test the PREDETERMINED maximum location \\nwithin the zone.  Give a 1/4 degree reaim to any test point or maximum intensity location \\nthat exceeds that maximum permitted candela.   Any test measurement which exceeds \\nthe maximum shall be remeasured at a time approaching, but not exceeding 60.49 \\nseconds, i.e. 50-60 seconds, since test meas urements taken it the earlier part of the \\nallotted 60 seconds, i.e., 0-10 or even at  10-20 seconds, may be higher than would be \\nobtained later in the allotted time period.  If multiple test points have maximums, it is \\npermitted to repeat the test at many times as  necessary to test all test points with \\nmaximums within the latter portion of the allotted time, i.e., 50-60 seconds. \\n \\n5.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.  Issued:  6/24/98   Revised:  08/31/00   Revision Level 4.0 \\nCONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 80 11/4/2011 (per SAE J1330 section 3.2.2).  Positioner accuracy is controlled by G805WI-LL-C-\\n001. \\n3. The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.  These bulbs are reca librated per G805-LL-C-001in accord with SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.8.3, except the annual recalibration has been replaced with a \\noperating time based calibration, which is  based on the interval recommended by the \\ncalibrating laboratory. \\n7. Note, that  there are filament or light source parameters that are not controlled in \\naccurate rated bulbs and these parameter s in \\\"some lighting devices may produce \\nsignificantly different luminous intensity measurements with two different accurate \\nrated bulbs, particularly lighting devices wi th particularly short focal lengths.\\\" SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.6). \\n8. The sensor/photometer system is desi gned and used within the guidelines for color \\nresponse, HID source use, range linearit y and sensor aperture size that are \\ncontained within SAE J1330 JUN94 sections 3. 7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3,  3.7.4 and 3.7.5.

The manufacturing plant will describe th ese process changes in th e Control Plan, along with \\neither (1) the revalidation plan th at would be followed in each case, or (2) a provision to submit an \\namended Control Plan for approval if any of those pr ocess changes are planned. No change to processing \\nmay be allowed without prior engineering approval of the process changes and the attendant Control Plan \\nchanges.   \\nB. DESIGN CHANGES - \\n Any changes in material or material sources must be revalidated for durability and material compatibility.  Any changes in material, design or tooling must be evaluated for their potential impact on: \\n1)  the real world safety of the vehicle,  \\n2)  the homologation status of the vehicle,  \\n3)  the self certification status  per FMVSS/CMVSS/ADR/etc.,  \\n4)  the ability to meet the customers safety design guidelines,  \\n5)  the crash performance of the vehicle and/or component and \\n6)  the customers safety related compliance requirements, i.e. WCR. \\n \\nThe potential impact of any of the above fact ors should be communicated  in writing to both: \\na)  the customer safety/regulatory representative via WERS or equivalent or email and  \\nb)  the Regulatory Compliance Engineer for Exterior Lighting  \\nwho shall provide assistance in determining what tests must be done (if any) to demonstrate that certification and/or homologation complia nce, safety factors/acceptance crite ria and safety related customer \\nrequirements have not been compromised.  \\n  \\nC.
