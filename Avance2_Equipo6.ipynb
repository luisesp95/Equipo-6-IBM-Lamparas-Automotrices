GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS \\n \\n5.1. Each sample shall conform to the specifi cations set forth in paragraphs 6 to 8 \\nbelow. \\n 5.2. Headlamps shall be so made as to  retain their prescribed photometric \\ncharacteristics and to remain in good working order when in normal use, in spite of the vibrations to which they may be subjected. \\n 5.2.1. Headlamps shall be fitted with a device enabling them to be so adjusted on the \\nvehicles as to comply with the rules applicable to them.  Such a device need not be fitted on units in wh ich the reflector and the diffusing lens cannot be \\nseparated, provided the use of such units is confined to vehicles on which the \\nheadlamp setting can be adjusted by other means.  \\n \\n                                                \\n \\n5/  Technical requirements for fila ment lamps: see Regulation No. 37.  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 13   \\n \\n Where a headlamp providing a passing beam and a headlamp providing a \\ndriving beam, each equipped with its ow n filament lamp, are assembled to \\nform a composite unit the adjusting device shall enable each optical system individually to be duly adjusted. \\n 5.2.2. However, these provisions shall not apply to headlamp assemblies whose \\nreflectors are indivisible. For this t ype of assembly the requirements of \\nparagraph 6.3. of this Regulation apply. \\n 5.3. The headlamp shall be equipped with filament lamp(s) approved according to \\nRegulation No. 37.  Any Regulation N o. 37 filament lamp may be used, \\nprovided that no restriction on the applica tion is made in the table of contents \\nof Regulation No. 37. 6\\n/ \\n 5.4. The components by which a filament lamp is fixed to the reflector shall be so \\nmade that, even in darkness, the filament lamp can be fixed in no position but the correct one. 7\\n/ \\n 5.5. The filament lamp holder shall confor m to the characteristics given in IEC \\nPublication 61-2, third edit ion, 1969.  The holder data sheet relevant to the \\ncategory of filament lamp used, applies. \\n 5.6. Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic may be adapted for traffic on a given side of the road either by an \\nappropriate initial setting when fitted on the vehicle or by selective setting by \\nthe user. Such initial or selective setti ng may consist, for example, of fixing \\neither the optical unit at a given angle on the vehicle or the filament lamp at a \\ngiven angle in relation to the optical unit. In all cas es, only two different and \\nclearly distinct settings, one for right-h and and one for left-hand traffic, shall \\nbe possible, and the design shall pr eclude inadvertent shifting from one \\nsetting to the other or setting in an in termediate position. Where two different \\nsetting positions are provided for th e filament lamp, the components for \\nattaching the filament lamp to the re flector must be so designed and made \\n                                                \\n \\n6/  HIR1 and/or H9 filament lamps shall only be permitted to produce passing beam in \\nconjunction with the insta llation of headlamp cleani ng device(s) conforming to \\nRegulation No. 45.  In addition, with respect  to vertical inclin ation, the provision of \\nparagraph 6.2.6.2.2. of Regulation N o. 48, 01 series of amendments, shall not be applied when \\nthese lamps are installed. \\n  This restriction shall apply as long as there is no general agreement on the use of levelling \\ndevices and headlamp cleaners with respect to the level of the perfor mance of the headlamp. \\n7\\n/  A headlamp is regarded as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the filament lamp \\ncan be easily fitted into the headlamp and the pos itioning lugs can be correctly fitted into their \\nslots even in darkness.

Complementary tests shall be done acco rding to the requirements of Annex 4 \\nto ensure that in use there is no exce ssive change in photometric performance. \\n 5.8. If the lens of the headlamp is of plas tic material, tests sh all be done according \\nto the requirements of Annex 6. \\n 5.9. On headlamps designed to provide alte rnately a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, or a passing beam and/or a driv ing beam designed to become bend \\nlighting, any mechanical, el ectromechanical or other device incorporated in \\nthe headlamp for these purposes shall be so constructed that: \\n 5.9.1. the device is strong enough to with stand 50,000 operations without suffering \\ndamage despite the vibrations to whic h it may be subjected in normal use; \\n 5.9.2. in the case of failure the illumination above the line H-H shall not exceed the \\nvalues of a passing beam according to paragraph 6.2.5.; in addition, on headlamps designed to provide a passing and/or a driving beam to become a \\nbend lighting, a minimum illumination of at least 5 lux shall be fulfilled in test point 25 V (VV line, D 75 cm). \\n 5.9.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without \\nany possibility of the mechanis m stopping in between two positions; \\n 5.9.4. the user cannot, with ordi nary tools, change the shape or position of the \\nmoving parts. \\n 6. ILLUMINATION  6.1. General provisions\\n \\n 6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that th ey give adequate illumination without \\ndazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting the driving beam. \\n 6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of \\na vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its \\naxes as shown in Annex 3 to this Regulation. \\n 6.1.3. The headlamps shall be checked by mean s of an uncoloured standard (\\u00e9talon) \\nfilament lamp designed for a rated volta ge of 12 V.  During the checking of  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 15   \\n \\n the headlamp, the voltage at the terminals of the filament lamp shall be \\nregulated so as to obtain the refere nce luminous flux as indicated at the \\nrelevant data sheet of Regulation No. 37. \\n 6.1.4. The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of \\nthis paragraph 6 with at least one sta ndard (\\u00e9talon) filament lamp, which may \\nbe submitted with the headlamp. \\n 6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:  6.2.2.1. in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand \\ntraffic, the \\\"cut-off\\\" on the left-half of the screen 8\\n/ is horizontal and, in the \\ncase of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left -hand traffic, the \\n\\\"cut-off\\\" on the right-half of the screen is horizontal; \\n 6.2.2.2. this horizontal part of the \\\"cut-off\\\" is  situated on the sc reen 25 cm below the \\nlevel hh (see Annex 3);  \\n \\n6.2.2.3. the \\\"elbow\\\" of the \\\"c ut-off\\\" is on line vv. 9\\n/ \\n 6.2.3. When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely for \\nprovision of a passing beam, 10\\n/ comply only with the requirements set out in  \\n                                                 \\n8/  The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the \\\"cut-off\\\" over a range of \\nat least 5\\u00b0 on either side of the line vv. \\n \\n9/  If the beam does not have a cut-off with a clear \\\"elbow\\\", the lateral adjustment shall be \\neffected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for illumination at points 75 R and \\n50 R for right-hand traffic and for points  75 L and 50 L for left-hand traffic. \\n 10\\n/  Such a special \\\"passing beam\\\" headlamp ma y incorporate a driving beam not subject to \\nrequirements.

Where a headlamp so aimed does not meet the requirements set out in \\nparagraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and 6.3., its alignment may be changed, provided that the axis of the beam is not displ aced laterally by more than 1\\u00b0 (= 44 cm) \\nto the right or left. 11\\n/ To facilitate alignment by means of the \\\"cut-off\\\", the \\nheadlamp may be partially occulted in order to sharpen the \\\"cut-off\\\". \\n 6.2.5. The illumination produced on the screen by the passing beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements: \\n \\n6.2.6. There shall be no lateral va riations detrimental to good visibility in any of the \\nzones I, II, III and IV. \\n 6.2.7. The illumination values in zones \\\"A\\\" and \\\"B\\\" as shown in figure C in \\nAnnex 3 shall be checked by the measur ement of the photometric values of \\n                                                \\n \\n11/  The limit of realignment of 1\\u00b0 towards the right  or left is not incompatible with upward or \\ndownward vertical realig nment.  The latter is limited only by the requirements of paragraph 6.3. \\nHowever, the horizontal part of the \\\"cut -off\\\" should not extend beyond the line hh \\n(the provisions of paragra ph 6.3. are not applicable to h eadlamps intended to meet the \\nrequirements of this Regulation only for provision of a passing beam).

The requirements in paragraph 6.2.5. above shall also ap ply to headlamps \\ndesigned to provide bend lighting and/or  that include the additional light \\nsource referred to in paragraph 6.2.10.2. \\n 6.2.9.1. If bend lighting is obtained by:  6.2.9.1.1. swivelling the passing beam or moving horizontally the kink  of the elbow of \\nthe cut-off, the measurements shall be carried out after the complete \\nheadlamp assembly has been reai med horizontally, e.g. by means of a \\ngoniometer; \\n 6.2.9.1.2. moving one or more optical parts of the headlamp without moving \\nhorizontally the kink of the elbow of the cut-off, measurements shall be \\ncarried out with these parts being in their extreme operating position; \\n \\n6.2.9.1.3. means of one additional light source without moving horizontally the kink of \\nthe elbow of the cut-off, measurements shall be carried out with this light \\nsource activated. \\n 6.2.10. Only one principal light source is pe rmitted for each passing beam headlamp.  \\nHowever, a maximum of two additional light sources are permitted as follows: \\n 6.2.10.1. One additional light source inside the passing beam headlamp according to \\nRegulation No. 37 may be used to  contribute to  bend lighting. \\n \\n                                                \\n \\n12/  Illumination values in any point of zones A a nd B, which also lies within zone III, shall not \\nexceed 0.7 lux.

One additional light source according to Regulation No. 37, inside the passing \\nbeam headlamp, may be used for the purposes of generating infrared radiation.  It shall only be activated at  the same time as the principal light \\nsource.  In the event that the principal light source fails, this additional light source shall be automatically switched off. \\n 6.2.10.3. In the event of failure of an addi tional light source, the headlamp shall \\ncontinue to fulfil the requirements of the passing beam. \\n 6.3. Provisions concerning driving beams\\n \\n 6.3.1. In the case of a headlamp designed to  provide a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, measurements of the illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall be taken with the same headlamp alignment as for measurements under paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. above; in the case of a \\nheadlamp providing a driving beam only, it shall be so adjusted that the area \\nof maximum illumination is centred on th e point of intersection of lines hh \\nand vv; such a headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in \\nparagraph 6.3. \\n 6.3.2. It is possible to use several light sources for the driving beam.  6.3.3. The illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements. \\n 6.3.3.1. The point of intersection (HV) of lines hh and vv shall be si tuated within the \\nisolux 80 per cent of maximum illumination. This maximum value (E\\nM) shall \\nnot be less than 32 lux for Class A headlamps and 48 lux for Class B \\nheadlamps.  The maximum value shall in no circumstances exceed 240 lux; in \\naddition, in the case of a combined passing and driving headlamp, this \\nmaximum value shall not be more than  16 times the illumination measured for \\nthe passing beam at point 75 R (or 75 L). \\n 6.3.3.1.1. The maximum intensity (I\\nM) of the driving beam e xpressed in thousands of \\ncandelas shall be calculated by the formula: \\n  I\\nM = 0.625 E M \\n 6.3.3.1.2. The reference mark (I\\n'\\nM) of this maximum intensity, referred to in \\nparagraph 4.2.2.7. above, shall be obtained by the ratio: \\n \\n  \\n \\n I'I\\n30.208  EMM\\nM == E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 19   \\n \\n This value shall be rounded off to the value 7.5 - 10 - 12.5 - 17.5 - 20 - 25 - \\n27.5 - 30 - 37.5 - 40 - 45 - 50. \\n 6.3.3.2.

In the case of headlamps with adju stable reflector the requirements of \\nparagraphs 6.2. and 6.3. are applicable for each mounting position indicated according to paragraph 2.1.3.  For verifi cation the following procedure shall \\nbe used: \\n 6.4.1. Each applied position is realized on the test goniometer with respect to a line \\njoining the centre of the light source  and point HV on a aiming screen.  The \\nadjustable reflector is then moved into such a position that the light pattern on \\nthe screen corresponds to the aiming pr escriptions of paragraphs 6.2.1. to \\n6.2.2.3. and/or 6.3.1; \\n 6.4.2. with the reflector initially fixed acco rding to paragraph 6.4.1., the headlamp \\nmust meet the relevant photometric re quirements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3; \\n \\n6.4.3. additional tests are made after the reflector has been moved vertically \\u00b1 2\\u00b0 or \\nat least into the maximum position, if less than 2\\u00b0, from its initial position by \\nmeans of the headlamps adjusting device. Having re-aimed the headlamp as a whole (by means of the goniometer fo r example) in the corresponding \\nopposite direction the light output in the following directions shall be \\ncontrolled and lie within the required limits: \\n \\npassing beam : points HV and 75 R (75 L respectively); driving beam : E\\nM and point HV (percentage of E M). \\n \\n6.4.4. if the applicant has not indicated more than one mounting position,  the \\nprocedure of paragraphs 6.4.1. to 6.4.3. shall be repeated for all other \\npositions; \\n 6.4.5. if the applicant has no t asked for special mounti ng positions, the headlamp \\nshall be aimed for measurements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3. with the \\nheadlamps adjusting device in its m ean position.  The additional test of \\nparagraph 6.4.3. shall be made with the reflector moved into its extreme positions (instead of \\n+ 2\\u00b0) by means of the headlamps adjusting device. \\n 6.5. The screen illumination values mentioned in paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and \\n6.3. above shall be measured by means of a photo receptor, the effective area of which shall be contained within a square of 65 mm side.

Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

Energize the low beam filament at 12.8 V DC and visually adjust the aim of \\nthe headlamp until the upper cutoff at 2 \\u00b0R is on the horizontal (0.0 \\u00b0D) for \\nVOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L is at 0.4 \\u00b0D for VOL . \\nThis aiming should be done on a test screen at least 25 feet from the lamp. \\n2. Fine tune the aim using the com puter software by scanning in  0.10 \\u00b0 \\nincrements from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to 1.5 \\u00b0 D at 2\\u00b0 R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL to \\ndetermine the point at which the maximum gradient occurs. \\nUse software or the following formula to find the maximum gradient: G=logE(a) - logE(a+0.1)           where G=gradient,  a=vetical angular position (degrees) , E(a)=candela. The maximum gradient must \\\"be not less than .13\\u2026\\\" otherwise record that the \\nCENTER GRADIENT FAILED.  \\n3. After finding the vertical location of the maximum gradient, the software/ \\noperator must set: a) the maximum gradient of VOR headlamps to be at the \\nvertical zero (0.0 \\u00b0D) of the goniometer, or b) the maximum gradient of VOL \\nheadlamps to be at 0.4D. \\n4.

This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.

The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.  These bulbs are reca librated per G805-LL-C-001in accord with SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.8.3, except the annual recalibration has been replaced with a \\noperating time based calibration, which is  based on the interval recommended by the \\ncalibrating laboratory. \\n7. Note, that  there are filament or light source parameters that are not controlled in \\naccurate rated bulbs and these parameter s in \\\"some lighting devices may produce \\nsignificantly different luminous intensity measurements with two different accurate \\nrated bulbs, particularly lighting devices wi th particularly short focal lengths.\\\" SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.6). \\n8. The sensor/photometer system is desi gned and used within the guidelines for color \\nresponse, HID source use, range linearit y and sensor aperture size that are \\ncontained within SAE J1330 JUN94 sections 3. 7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3,  3.7.4 and 3.7.5.

CONTROL PLAN - \\n \\nThe Manufacturing Plant and Viste on Product Engineering Office will jo intly determine which potential \\nprocess changes would have signi ficant impact on the product's func tion, performance, durability or \\nappearance.  The manufacturing plant will describe th ese process changes in th e Control Plan, along with \\neither (1) the revalidation plan th at would be followed in each case, or (2) a provision to submit an \\namended Control Plan for approval if any of those pr ocess changes are planned. No change to processing \\nmay be allowed without prior engineering approval of the process changes and the attendant Control Plan \\nchanges.   \\nB. DESIGN CHANGES - \\n Any changes in material or material sources must be revalidated for durability and material compatibility.  Any changes in material, design or tooling must be evaluated for their potential impact on: \\n1)  the real world safety of the vehicle,  \\n2)  the homologation status of the vehicle,  \\n3)  the self certification status  per FMVSS/CMVSS/ADR/etc.,  \\n4)  the ability to meet the customers safety design guidelines,  \\n5)  the crash performance of the vehicle and/or component and \\n6)  the customers safety related compliance requirements, i.e. WCR. \\n \\nThe potential impact of any of the above fact ors should be communicated  in writing to both: \\na)  the customer safety/regulatory representative via WERS or equivalent or email and  \\nb)  the Regulatory Compliance Engineer for Exterior Lighting  \\nwho shall provide assistance in determining what tests must be done (if any) to demonstrate that certification and/or homologation complia nce, safety factors/acceptance crite ria and safety related customer \\nrequirements have not been compromised.  \\n  \\nC.  AIMING PAD (NIB) EVALUATION - \\n \\nConduct an annual engineering evalua tion.  A suggested amount of 3 pair/cavity combination of each \\nheadlamp shall be submitted to the product engineering lighting laboratory for verifi cation of correct aim.  \\nIf the aim is found outside acceptable limits the amount of  adjustment required to the aiming pads will be \\nprovided by engineering.  \\n  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

Production Lot - The total number of parts per hand, per cavity, per carline, manufactured during one  \\nproduction shift.  \\n B. Production Unit - The total number of parts of one type produced by one manufacturing group of \\nmachines (assembly line during one production shift). \\n C. Prime Source - The plant where the part is act ually being manufactured, or that plant which  \\n performs the operation which controls the characteristics.  The part may not necessarily be supplied  directly to the customer, but may be shipped to a second supplier or manufacturing plant.  In some \\ninstances, an OEM plant ma y be the prime source. \\n D. Replaceable Bulb Headlamp - Shall include h eadlamp assembly (13005-6) , wiring connector male \\nsleeve assembly (14A464) and 16 gage wire (ESF-MIL 56A) unless specified otherwise.  For testing, \\nheadlamp breathing devices or other design openi ngs shall be in their normal operating positions \\nunless otherwise specified. \\n E. Seasoning -   Process of energizing the filament of a headlamp at design voltage for a period of time  equivalent to 1% of average rated laboratory life.  Other equivalent methods are acceptable. \\n F.           Control Plans address all significant design and process characteristics, including all Control Item \\ncharacteristics.  They describe the process pot ential studies that will be performed for product \\nvalidation (including certification and PSW tests)  and the ongoing product and process evaluation for \\ncontinuing improvement (i ncluding IP tests).  They include  acceptance criteria, sample sizes, \\nfrequencies, data analysis methods and reaction plans. \\n \\nThe Control Plan is developed, and updated as necessary, by the ma nufacturing source in conjunction  \\n with the design responsible Product Engineering ac tivity and other appropriate functions such as \\nSTA. The Control Plan defines the management of th e upstream production process and part variables \\n (significant process characteristics)  that affect the outcome of the laboratory tests or other significant \\ndesign characteristics.  The Control Plan also identifies the specific laboratory tests, with their sample \\nsizes and frequencies, that will be performed in order to: \\n \\n        . Confirm whether the process is being managed effectively.         . Further identify significant process characteristics. \\n        . Evaluate performance of marginal processes.         .

Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:  6.2.2.1. in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand \\ntraffic, the \\\"cut-off\\\" on the left-half of the screen 8\\n/ is horizontal and, in the \\ncase of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left -hand traffic, the \\n\\\"cut-off\\\" on the right-half of the screen is horizontal; \\n 6.2.2.2. this horizontal part of the \\\"cut-off\\\" is  situated on the sc reen 25 cm below the \\nlevel hh (see Annex 3);  \\n \\n6.2.2.3. the \\\"elbow\\\" of the \\\"c ut-off\\\" is on line vv. 9\\n/ \\n 6.2.3. When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely for \\nprovision of a passing beam, 10\\n/ comply only with the requirements set out in  \\n                                                 \\n8/  The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the \\\"cut-off\\\" over a range of \\nat least 5\\u00b0 on either side of the line vv. \\n \\n9/  If the beam does not have a cut-off with a clear \\\"elbow\\\", the lateral adjustment shall be \\neffected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for illumination at points 75 R and \\n50 R for right-hand traffic and for points  75 L and 50 L for left-hand traffic. \\n 10\\n/  Such a special \\\"passing beam\\\" headlamp ma y incorporate a driving beam not subject to \\nrequirements.

Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

Headlamps:  All bulbs used for photomet ric testing must have lower and/or upper \\nbeam filaments (if any) positioned within +/ - 0.125 mm (0.005 inch) axially, vertically \\nand horizontally of design location relative to  the lamp socket.  This specification is \\ntighter than is required by applicable regulations. \\n2. Non-Headlamps:  All replaceable, i.e.  non-sealed in lamp, bulbs must have the \\nfilaments (if any) positioned within +/- 0. 25 mm (0.010 inch) axially, vertically and \\nhorizontally of design location relative to the lamp, as specified in SAE J573d or by \\nthe bulb manufacturer.  \\nNOTE: This requirement derives fr om the FMVSS/CMVSS regulation which \\nreferences SAE J575e (Aug. 1980) (which references SAE J387). \\n \\n(b) Conditioning:  All bulbs used for photomet ric and wattage tests must be conditioned before \\nthe first use by operating at nominal design voltage for one percent of their average rated \\nlaboratory life.   \\n(c) On-Time: \\n1. Incandescent filament(s), allow a minimum of three minutes to stabilize the output of \\nthe bulb(s) prior to making maximum and minimum measurements. \\n2. Other light emitting devices, determi ne their performance characteristics in \\nrelationship to light output vs. time. Measur e and record the light output of the device \\nfor the worst case condition if significant changes in performance occur and document the duration of the on-time. \\n3. LED lighting devices, measure and reco rd the maximum output of the device \\nimmediately (within 60 sec.) after applying pow er to the device; allow internal heat \\nbuildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization time,  prior to measuring and recording individual test point data; and for the dust test, measure and record the maximum output of the device after internal heat bu ildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization \\ntime. \\nNOTE: This requirement der ives from SAE J1889 Oct93.

The \\n1/4 degree re-aim (tolerance of 0.25 degrees) is  considered to mean within a cone with a \\n1/4 degree radius . \\n5.1.1. Low-Beam Photometry \\n(a) Mount the alignment test fixture on the loca ting pins of the goniometer, with the low beam \\nfocal point at the center.  Adjust the height  of the goniometer so that the sample\\u2019s \\nmechanical axis is the same height as the photodetector. \\n(b) Rotate the goniometer to the aiming plane position. (c) Aim the Low Beam using the appropriate headlamp aim system from (c) 1), 2),  3) or 4)  \\n1. Aiming External Aim Headlamps:  headlamps  which use separate, external aimers \\nthat rest on the headlamps aiming pads (nibs), includes sealed beams\\n. \\nA) Install a mirror on the surface of the aiming pads. B) Turn on a laser positioned at a known location relative to the H-V axis and \\nadjust the aiming plane of the headlamp to  0,0 by rotating the aiming screws. \\nC) Remove the mirror. D) Install a nominal bulb in the headlamp assembly. \\nNOTE: In the future multiple light sources may be permitted, if they are \\nlegal and required by a particular design and some sources are independently adjustable in relation to the first, repeat the previous steps for the additional independently aimable light sources. \\ne) Go to step 5.1.1.(d) Low beam Measurement  \\n2.

Use the \\nmirror on the slave fixture to reset t he horizontal zero. Mount the headlamp on \\nthe test fixture. \\nb) Adjust the vertical aim of t he \\\"VOR\\\" or \\\"VOL\\\" headlamp as follows: \\n1. Energize the low beam filament at 12.8 V DC and visually adjust the aim of \\nthe headlamp until the upper cutoff at 2 \\u00b0R is on the horizontal (0.0 \\u00b0D) for \\nVOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L is at 0.4 \\u00b0D for VOL . \\nThis aiming should be done on a test screen at least 25 feet from the lamp. \\n2. Fine tune the aim using the com puter software by scanning in  0.10 \\u00b0 \\nincrements from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to 1.5 \\u00b0 D at 2\\u00b0 R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL to \\ndetermine the point at which the maximum gradient occurs. \\nUse software or the following formula to find the maximum gradient: G=logE(a) - logE(a+0.1)           where G=gradient,  a=vetical angular position (degrees) , E(a)=candela. The maximum gradient must \\\"be not less than .13\\u2026\\\" otherwise record that the \\nCENTER GRADIENT FAILED.  \\n3.

The meas urements should use the \\u00bc reaim permitted \\nif a value exceeding the maximum is found. \\nNOTE: Where the 10U-90U area is specified  instead of a test point, the \\nmeasurement should be across the specifi ed horizontal line and up a vertical line \\nstarting on the horizontal line where the maximum intensity reading was \\nobtained.  These measurements should use the 1 degree reaim (2 degree cone) \\npermitted in Step 6 .  \\n5.

This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6. Visually locate\\n within the region 10U to 90U - L to R any areas that are receiving \\nexcessively bright light. If such an area ex ists, scan the bright area to locate the \\napparent maximum intensity location and record the candlepower value and the position. Also record the candlepower va lue and position of all points within a 1 \\ndegree radius about the apparent maximum intensity location at 0.125 degree intervals. Find the actual highest intensity location by determining the center of the \\nhighest values obtained.  \\nActual highest intensity cd values that  are greater than 438 cd should be noted as \\nexceeding the maximum (FAIL), in addition, values exceeding 125 cd should also be \\nmarked as exceeding the maximum (FAIL), unless a 125 cd or lower value can be \\nfound within a 2 degree cone (1 degree reai m) around the actual highest intensity.  \\nNOTE:  The 2 degree cone is defined in  the rationale of  SAE J1383 JUN 90 and \\nalso in ECE R48 as the maximum area of spots of light that can exceed \\nthe maximum candlepower applied, i.e. 125 cd, to portions of the beam  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

NHTSA's Pat Boyd \\nannounced at the Fall 1997 SAE Lighting Committee meeting that the \\nrewrite of FMVSS 108 in 1998 will allow a maximum of 438 cd within a 2 \\ndegree cone for all low beam headlamps.  This was confirmed by \\nNHTSA's Rich Van Iderstine on 5/27/98 after he consulted with Pat \\nBoyd.  Therefore, this criteria can confidently be used for, at least, all \\nheadlamps that are for 1999 model vehicles or later.  \\n7.

The Product \\nEngineer must supply a pitch angle number and tolerance OR both upward and downward pitch angle numbers that he wants to certify the vehicle to.  The vehicle pitch number(s) submitted and used for testing should must be equal to or greater than the vehicle pitch number(s) of the vehicle approved fo r production.

Design voltage is the nominal voltage that t he vehicle will supply to the connector for the \\ncomponent.  North American Tail lamps are ty pically 14.0V and stop lamps are typically \\n12.8V.  However, ask the OEM to specify the nominal design voltage for the function \\nwhich could be different for the wiring, swit ching, resistors, voltage reduction modules \\netc. \\n  2. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage for 30 min, THEN run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with mi nimum requirements.   Also determine the \\nmaximum intensity location. \\n \\n3. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage and IMMEDIATELY run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with maxi mum requirements within 60 seconds, that is \\nbetween 0 and 60.49 seconds).   \\n \\n4. For lamps like CHMSLs with a maximum zone (10L to 10R and from 10U to 5D) (typically \\nalso equal to the furthest test points), test the PREDETERMINED maximum location \\nwithin the zone.  Give a 1/4 degree reaim to any test point or maximum intensity location \\nthat exceeds that maximum permitted candela.   Any test measurement which exceeds \\nthe maximum shall be remeasured at a time approaching, but not exceeding 60.49 \\nseconds, i.e. 50-60 seconds, since test meas urements taken it the earlier part of the \\nallotted 60 seconds, i.e., 0-10 or even at  10-20 seconds, may be higher than would be \\nobtained later in the allotted time period.  If multiple test points have maximums, it is \\npermitted to repeat the test at many times as  necessary to test all test points with \\nmaximums within the latter portion of the allotted time, i.e., 50-60 seconds. \\n \\n5. CHMSLs shall meet the photometric mini mums of FMVSS 108 Table 10; note the test \\npoint and zones are the same as SAEJ 1957 JUN 93, but the maximums are \\nDIFFERENT.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.

The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.  These bulbs are reca librated per G805-LL-C-001in accord with SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.8.3, except the annual recalibration has been replaced with a \\noperating time based calibration, which is  based on the interval recommended by the \\ncalibrating laboratory. \\n7. Note, that  there are filament or light source parameters that are not controlled in \\naccurate rated bulbs and these parameter s in \\\"some lighting devices may produce \\nsignificantly different luminous intensity measurements with two different accurate \\nrated bulbs, particularly lighting devices wi th particularly short focal lengths.\\\" SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.6). \\n8. The sensor/photometer system is desi gned and used within the guidelines for color \\nresponse, HID source use, range linearit y and sensor aperture size that are \\ncontained within SAE J1330 JUN94 sections 3. 7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3,  3.7.4 and 3.7.5.

Headlamps shall be so made as to  retain their prescribed photometric \\ncharacteristics and to remain in good working order when in normal use, in spite of the vibrations to which they may be subjected. \\n 5.2.1. Headlamps shall be fitted with a device enabling them to be so adjusted on the \\nvehicles as to comply with the rules applicable to them.  Such a device need not be fitted on units in wh ich the reflector and the diffusing lens cannot be \\nseparated, provided the use of such units is confined to vehicles on which the \\nheadlamp setting can be adjusted by other means.  \\n \\n                                                \\n \\n5/  Technical requirements for fila ment lamps: see Regulation No. 37.  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 13   \\n \\n Where a headlamp providing a passing beam and a headlamp providing a \\ndriving beam, each equipped with its ow n filament lamp, are assembled to \\nform a composite unit the adjusting device shall enable each optical system individually to be duly adjusted. \\n 5.2.2. However, these provisions shall not apply to headlamp assemblies whose \\nreflectors are indivisible. For this t ype of assembly the requirements of \\nparagraph 6.3. of this Regulation apply. \\n 5.3. The headlamp shall be equipped with filament lamp(s) approved according to \\nRegulation No. 37.  Any Regulation N o. 37 filament lamp may be used, \\nprovided that no restriction on the applica tion is made in the table of contents \\nof Regulation No. 37. 6\\n/ \\n 5.4. The components by which a filament lamp is fixed to the reflector shall be so \\nmade that, even in darkness, the filament lamp can be fixed in no position but the correct one. 7\\n/ \\n 5.5. The filament lamp holder shall confor m to the characteristics given in IEC \\nPublication 61-2, third edit ion, 1969.  The holder data sheet relevant to the \\ncategory of filament lamp used, applies. \\n 5.6. Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic may be adapted for traffic on a given side of the road either by an \\nappropriate initial setting when fitted on the vehicle or by selective setting by \\nthe user. Such initial or selective setti ng may consist, for example, of fixing \\neither the optical unit at a given angle on the vehicle or the filament lamp at a \\ngiven angle in relation to the optical unit. In all cas es, only two different and \\nclearly distinct settings, one for right-h and and one for left-hand traffic, shall \\nbe possible, and the design shall pr eclude inadvertent shifting from one \\nsetting to the other or setting in an in termediate position. Where two different \\nsetting positions are provided for th e filament lamp, the components for \\nattaching the filament lamp to the re flector must be so designed and made \\n                                                \\n \\n6/  HIR1 and/or H9 filament lamps shall only be permitted to produce passing beam in \\nconjunction with the insta llation of headlamp cleani ng device(s) conforming to \\nRegulation No. 45.  In addition, with respect  to vertical inclin ation, the provision of \\nparagraph 6.2.6.2.2. of Regulation N o. 48, 01 series of amendments, shall not be applied when \\nthese lamps are installed. \\n  This restriction shall apply as long as there is no general agreement on the use of levelling \\ndevices and headlamp cleaners with respect to the level of the perfor mance of the headlamp. \\n7\\n/  A headlamp is regarded as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the filament lamp \\ncan be easily fitted into the headlamp and the pos itioning lugs can be correctly fitted into their \\nslots even in darkness.

Conformity with the requirements of this pa ragraph shall be verified \\nby visual inspection and, wher e necessary, by a test fitting. \\n 5.7. Complementary tests shall be done acco rding to the requirements of Annex 4 \\nto ensure that in use there is no exce ssive change in photometric performance. \\n 5.8. If the lens of the headlamp is of plas tic material, tests sh all be done according \\nto the requirements of Annex 6. \\n 5.9. On headlamps designed to provide alte rnately a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, or a passing beam and/or a driv ing beam designed to become bend \\nlighting, any mechanical, el ectromechanical or other device incorporated in \\nthe headlamp for these purposes shall be so constructed that: \\n 5.9.1. the device is strong enough to with stand 50,000 operations without suffering \\ndamage despite the vibrations to whic h it may be subjected in normal use; \\n 5.9.2. in the case of failure the illumination above the line H-H shall not exceed the \\nvalues of a passing beam according to paragraph 6.2.5.; in addition, on headlamps designed to provide a passing and/or a driving beam to become a \\nbend lighting, a minimum illumination of at least 5 lux shall be fulfilled in test point 25 V (VV line, D 75 cm). \\n 5.9.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without \\nany possibility of the mechanis m stopping in between two positions; \\n 5.9.4. the user cannot, with ordi nary tools, change the shape or position of the \\nmoving parts. \\n 6. ILLUMINATION  6.1. General provisions\\n \\n 6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that th ey give adequate illumination without \\ndazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting the driving beam. \\n 6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of \\na vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its \\naxes as shown in Annex 3 to this Regulation. \\n 6.1.3. The headlamps shall be checked by mean s of an uncoloured standard (\\u00e9talon) \\nfilament lamp designed for a rated volta ge of 12 V.  During the checking of  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 15   \\n \\n the headlamp, the voltage at the terminals of the filament lamp shall be \\nregulated so as to obtain the refere nce luminous flux as indicated at the \\nrelevant data sheet of Regulation No. 37. \\n 6.1.4. The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of \\nthis paragraph 6 with at least one sta ndard (\\u00e9talon) filament lamp, which may \\nbe submitted with the headlamp. \\n 6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2.

In the case of a headlamp designed to  provide a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, measurements of the illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall be taken with the same headlamp alignment as for measurements under paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. above; in the case of a \\nheadlamp providing a driving beam only, it shall be so adjusted that the area \\nof maximum illumination is centred on th e point of intersection of lines hh \\nand vv; such a headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in \\nparagraph 6.3. \\n 6.3.2. It is possible to use several light sources for the driving beam.  6.3.3. The illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements. \\n 6.3.3.1. The point of intersection (HV) of lines hh and vv shall be si tuated within the \\nisolux 80 per cent of maximum illumination. This maximum value (E\\nM) shall \\nnot be less than 32 lux for Class A headlamps and 48 lux for Class B \\nheadlamps.  The maximum value shall in no circumstances exceed 240 lux; in \\naddition, in the case of a combined passing and driving headlamp, this \\nmaximum value shall not be more than  16 times the illumination measured for \\nthe passing beam at point 75 R (or 75 L). \\n 6.3.3.1.1. The maximum intensity (I\\nM) of the driving beam e xpressed in thousands of \\ncandelas shall be calculated by the formula: \\n  I\\nM = 0.625 E M \\n 6.3.3.1.2. The reference mark (I\\n'\\nM) of this maximum intensity, referred to in \\nparagraph 4.2.2.7. above, shall be obtained by the ratio: \\n \\n  \\n \\n I'I\\n30.208  EMM\\nM == E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 19   \\n \\n This value shall be rounded off to the value 7.5 - 10 - 12.5 - 17.5 - 20 - 25 - \\n27.5 - 30 - 37.5 - 40 - 45 - 50. \\n 6.3.3.2.

In the case of headlamps with adju stable reflector the requirements of \\nparagraphs 6.2. and 6.3. are applicable for each mounting position indicated according to paragraph 2.1.3.  For verifi cation the following procedure shall \\nbe used: \\n 6.4.1. Each applied position is realized on the test goniometer with respect to a line \\njoining the centre of the light source  and point HV on a aiming screen.  The \\nadjustable reflector is then moved into such a position that the light pattern on \\nthe screen corresponds to the aiming pr escriptions of paragraphs 6.2.1. to \\n6.2.2.3. and/or 6.3.1; \\n 6.4.2. with the reflector initially fixed acco rding to paragraph 6.4.1., the headlamp \\nmust meet the relevant photometric re quirements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3; \\n \\n6.4.3. additional tests are made after the reflector has been moved vertically \\u00b1 2\\u00b0 or \\nat least into the maximum position, if less than 2\\u00b0, from its initial position by \\nmeans of the headlamps adjusting device. Having re-aimed the headlamp as a whole (by means of the goniometer fo r example) in the corresponding \\nopposite direction the light output in the following directions shall be \\ncontrolled and lie within the required limits: \\n \\npassing beam : points HV and 75 R (75 L respectively); driving beam : E\\nM and point HV (percentage of E M). \\n \\n6.4.4. if the applicant has not indicated more than one mounting position,  the \\nprocedure of paragraphs 6.4.1. to 6.4.3. shall be repeated for all other \\npositions; \\n 6.4.5. if the applicant has no t asked for special mounti ng positions, the headlamp \\nshall be aimed for measurements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3. with the \\nheadlamps adjusting device in its m ean position.  The additional test of \\nparagraph 6.4.3. shall be made with the reflector moved into its extreme positions (instead of \\n+ 2\\u00b0) by means of the headlamps adjusting device. \\n 6.5. The screen illumination values mentioned in paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and \\n6.3. above shall be measured by means of a photo receptor, the effective area of which shall be contained within a square of 65 mm side.

Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

Energize the low beam filament at 12.8 V DC and visually adjust the aim of \\nthe headlamp until the upper cutoff at 2 \\u00b0R is on the horizontal (0.0 \\u00b0D) for \\nVOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L is at 0.4 \\u00b0D for VOL . \\nThis aiming should be done on a test screen at least 25 feet from the lamp. \\n2. Fine tune the aim using the com puter software by scanning in  0.10 \\u00b0 \\nincrements from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to 1.5 \\u00b0 D at 2\\u00b0 R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL to \\ndetermine the point at which the maximum gradient occurs. \\nUse software or the following formula to find the maximum gradient: G=logE(a) - logE(a+0.1)           where G=gradient,  a=vetical angular position (degrees) , E(a)=candela. The maximum gradient must \\\"be not less than .13\\u2026\\\" otherwise record that the \\nCENTER GRADIENT FAILED.  \\n3. After finding the vertical location of the maximum gradient, the software/ \\noperator must set: a) the maximum gradient of VOR headlamps to be at the \\nvertical zero (0.0 \\u00b0D) of the goniometer, or b) the maximum gradient of VOL \\nheadlamps to be at 0.4D. \\n4.

This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.

The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.  These bulbs are reca librated per G805-LL-C-001in accord with SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.8.3, except the annual recalibration has been replaced with a \\noperating time based calibration, which is  based on the interval recommended by the \\ncalibrating laboratory. \\n7. Note, that  there are filament or light source parameters that are not controlled in \\naccurate rated bulbs and these parameter s in \\\"some lighting devices may produce \\nsignificantly different luminous intensity measurements with two different accurate \\nrated bulbs, particularly lighting devices wi th particularly short focal lengths.\\\" SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.6). \\n8. The sensor/photometer system is desi gned and used within the guidelines for color \\nresponse, HID source use, range linearit y and sensor aperture size that are \\ncontained within SAE J1330 JUN94 sections 3. 7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3,  3.7.4 and 3.7.5.

CONTROL PLAN - \\n \\nThe Manufacturing Plant and Viste on Product Engineering Office will jo intly determine which potential \\nprocess changes would have signi ficant impact on the product's func tion, performance, durability or \\nappearance.  The manufacturing plant will describe th ese process changes in th e Control Plan, along with \\neither (1) the revalidation plan th at would be followed in each case, or (2) a provision to submit an \\namended Control Plan for approval if any of those pr ocess changes are planned. No change to processing \\nmay be allowed without prior engineering approval of the process changes and the attendant Control Plan \\nchanges.   \\nB. DESIGN CHANGES - \\n Any changes in material or material sources must be revalidated for durability and material compatibility.  Any changes in material, design or tooling must be evaluated for their potential impact on: \\n1)  the real world safety of the vehicle,  \\n2)  the homologation status of the vehicle,  \\n3)  the self certification status  per FMVSS/CMVSS/ADR/etc.,  \\n4)  the ability to meet the customers safety design guidelines,  \\n5)  the crash performance of the vehicle and/or component and \\n6)  the customers safety related compliance requirements, i.e. WCR. \\n \\nThe potential impact of any of the above fact ors should be communicated  in writing to both: \\na)  the customer safety/regulatory representative via WERS or equivalent or email and  \\nb)  the Regulatory Compliance Engineer for Exterior Lighting  \\nwho shall provide assistance in determining what tests must be done (if any) to demonstrate that certification and/or homologation complia nce, safety factors/acceptance crite ria and safety related customer \\nrequirements have not been compromised.  \\n  \\nC.  AIMING PAD (NIB) EVALUATION - \\n \\nConduct an annual engineering evalua tion.  A suggested amount of 3 pair/cavity combination of each \\nheadlamp shall be submitted to the product engineering lighting laboratory for verifi cation of correct aim.  \\nIf the aim is found outside acceptable limits the amount of  adjustment required to the aiming pads will be \\nprovided by engineering.  \\n  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

Production Lot - The total number of parts per hand, per cavity, per carline, manufactured during one  \\nproduction shift.  \\n B. Production Unit - The total number of parts of one type produced by one manufacturing group of \\nmachines (assembly line during one production shift). \\n C. Prime Source - The plant where the part is act ually being manufactured, or that plant which  \\n performs the operation which controls the characteristics.  The part may not necessarily be supplied  directly to the customer, but may be shipped to a second supplier or manufacturing plant.  In some \\ninstances, an OEM plant ma y be the prime source. \\n D. Replaceable Bulb Headlamp - Shall include h eadlamp assembly (13005-6) , wiring connector male \\nsleeve assembly (14A464) and 16 gage wire (ESF-MIL 56A) unless specified otherwise.  For testing, \\nheadlamp breathing devices or other design openi ngs shall be in their normal operating positions \\nunless otherwise specified. \\n E. Seasoning -   Process of energizing the filament of a headlamp at design voltage for a period of time  equivalent to 1% of average rated laboratory life.  Other equivalent methods are acceptable. \\n F.           Control Plans address all significant design and process characteristics, including all Control Item \\ncharacteristics.  They describe the process pot ential studies that will be performed for product \\nvalidation (including certification and PSW tests)  and the ongoing product and process evaluation for \\ncontinuing improvement (i ncluding IP tests).  They include  acceptance criteria, sample sizes, \\nfrequencies, data analysis methods and reaction plans. \\n \\nThe Control Plan is developed, and updated as necessary, by the ma nufacturing source in conjunction  \\n with the design responsible Product Engineering ac tivity and other appropriate functions such as \\nSTA. The Control Plan defines the management of th e upstream production process and part variables \\n (significant process characteristics)  that affect the outcome of the laboratory tests or other significant \\ndesign characteristics.  The Control Plan also identifies the specific laboratory tests, with their sample \\nsizes and frequencies, that will be performed in order to: \\n \\n        . Confirm whether the process is being managed effectively.         . Further identify significant process characteristics. \\n        . Evaluate performance of marginal processes.         .

The definitions given in Regulation N o. 48 and its series of amendments in \\nforce at the time of application for type approval shall apply to this \\nRegulation. \\n 2. APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF A HEADLAMP  2.1. The application for approval shall be  submitted by the owner of the trade \\nname or mark or by his duly accredite d representative. It  shall specify: \\n 2.1.1.  whether the headlamp is intended to provide both a passing beam and a \\ndriving beam or only one of these beams; \\n 2.1.2. whether, if the headlamp is intended to provide a passing beam, it is designed \\nfor both left-hand and right-hand traffic or for either left-hand or right-hand \\ntraffic only; \\n 2.1.3. if the headlamp is equipped with an adjustable reflector, the mounting \\nposition(s) of the headlamp in relation to the ground and the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle; \\n 2.1.4. whether it concerns a Class A or B headlamp;  2.1.5. the category of the filament lamp(s) used, as listed in Regulation No. 37. \\n 2.2. Every application for approval shall be accompanied by:  2.2.1. drawings in triplicate in sufficient de tail to permit identification of the type \\nand representing a frontal view of the h eadlamp, with details of lens ribbing if \\nany, and the cross-section; the drawings  shall indicate the space reserved for \\nthe approval mark; \\n 2.2.1.1. if the headlamp is equipped with an adjustable reflector, an indication of the \\nmounting position(s) of the headlamp  in relation to the ground and the \\nlongitudinal median plane of the vehicle, if the headlamp is for use in that (those) position(s) only; \\n 2.2.2. a brief technical descrip tion including, in the case where headlamps are used \\nto produce bend lighting, the extreme positions acc ording to paragraph 6.2.9. \\nbelow; \\n 2.2.3. two samples of the type of headlamp.  2.2.4. For the test of plastic material  of which the lenses are made: \\n 2.2.4.1. thirteen lenses;  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 7   \\n \\n 2.2.4.1.1. six of these lenses may be replaced  by six samples of material at least \\n60 x 80 mm in size, having a flat or convex outer surface and a substantially flat area (radius of curv ature not less than 300 mm)  in the middle measuring \\nat least 15 x 15 mm; \\n 2.2.4.1.2. every such lens or sample of materi al shall be produced by the method to be \\nused in mass production; \\n 2.2.4.2. a reflector to which the lenses can be fitted in accordance with the \\nmanufacturer's instructions. \\n 2.3. The materials making up the lenses a nd coatings, if any, shall be accompanied \\nby the test report of the characteristics of  these materials and coatings if they \\nhave already been tested. \\n 3. MARKINGS 2\\n/ \\n 3.1. Headlamps submitted for approval shall b ear the trade name or mark of the \\napplicant. \\n 3.2. They shall comprise, on the lens and on the main body, 3\\n/ spaces of sufficient \\nsize for the approval mark and the additional symbols referred to in paragraph 4; these spaces shall be indicat ed on the drawings referred to in \\nparagraph 2.2.1. above. \\n 3.3. Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic shall bear mark ings indicating the two sett ings of the optical unit \\non the vehicle or of the filament lamp  on the reflector; these markings shall \\nconsist of the letters \\\"R/D\\\" for the position for right-hand traffic and the \\nletters \\\"L/G\\\" for the position for left-hand traffic. \\n \\n    \\n                                                \\n \\n2/  In the case of headlamps designed to meet th e requirements of traffic moving on one side of \\nthe road only (either right or left), it is further recommended that the area which can be occulted to prevent discomfort to users in a country wh ere traffic moves on the side of the road opposite \\nto that of the country for which the headlamp was designed should be outlined indelibly on the \\nfront lens. This marking is not necessary, however , where the area is clearly apparent from the \\ndesign. \\n3\\n/  If the lens cannot be detached from th e main body of the headlamp, a unique marking  as per \\nparagraph 4.2.5.  shall be sufficient.  \\n  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505 } Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112  \\npage 8  \\n \\n 4.

Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic may be adapted for traffic on a given side of the road either by an \\nappropriate initial setting when fitted on the vehicle or by selective setting by \\nthe user. Such initial or selective setti ng may consist, for example, of fixing \\neither the optical unit at a given angle on the vehicle or the filament lamp at a \\ngiven angle in relation to the optical unit. In all cas es, only two different and \\nclearly distinct settings, one for right-h and and one for left-hand traffic, shall \\nbe possible, and the design shall pr eclude inadvertent shifting from one \\nsetting to the other or setting in an in termediate position. Where two different \\nsetting positions are provided for th e filament lamp, the components for \\nattaching the filament lamp to the re flector must be so designed and made \\n                                                \\n \\n6/  HIR1 and/or H9 filament lamps shall only be permitted to produce passing beam in \\nconjunction with the insta llation of headlamp cleani ng device(s) conforming to \\nRegulation No. 45.

Complementary tests shall be done acco rding to the requirements of Annex 4 \\nto ensure that in use there is no exce ssive change in photometric performance. \\n 5.8. If the lens of the headlamp is of plas tic material, tests sh all be done according \\nto the requirements of Annex 6. \\n 5.9. On headlamps designed to provide alte rnately a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, or a passing beam and/or a driv ing beam designed to become bend \\nlighting, any mechanical, el ectromechanical or other device incorporated in \\nthe headlamp for these purposes shall be so constructed that: \\n 5.9.1. the device is strong enough to with stand 50,000 operations without suffering \\ndamage despite the vibrations to whic h it may be subjected in normal use; \\n 5.9.2. in the case of failure the illumination above the line H-H shall not exceed the \\nvalues of a passing beam according to paragraph 6.2.5.; in addition, on headlamps designed to provide a passing and/or a driving beam to become a \\nbend lighting, a minimum illumination of at least 5 lux shall be fulfilled in test point 25 V (VV line, D 75 cm). \\n 5.9.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without \\nany possibility of the mechanis m stopping in between two positions; \\n 5.9.4. the user cannot, with ordi nary tools, change the shape or position of the \\nmoving parts. \\n 6. ILLUMINATION  6.1. General provisions\\n \\n 6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that th ey give adequate illumination without \\ndazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting the driving beam. \\n 6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of \\na vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its \\naxes as shown in Annex 3 to this Regulation. \\n 6.1.3. The headlamps shall be checked by mean s of an uncoloured standard (\\u00e9talon) \\nfilament lamp designed for a rated volta ge of 12 V.

The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of \\nthis paragraph 6 with at least one sta ndard (\\u00e9talon) filament lamp, which may \\nbe submitted with the headlamp. \\n 6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:  6.2.2.1. in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand \\ntraffic, the \\\"cut-off\\\" on the left-half of the screen 8\\n/ is horizontal and, in the \\ncase of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left -hand traffic, the \\n\\\"cut-off\\\" on the right-half of the screen is horizontal; \\n 6.2.2.2. this horizontal part of the \\\"cut-off\\\" is  situated on the sc reen 25 cm below the \\nlevel hh (see Annex 3);  \\n \\n6.2.2.3. the \\\"elbow\\\" of the \\\"c ut-off\\\" is on line vv. 9\\n/ \\n 6.2.3. When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely for \\nprovision of a passing beam, 10\\n/ comply only with the requirements set out in  \\n                                                 \\n8/  The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the \\\"cut-off\\\" over a range of \\nat least 5\\u00b0 on either side of the line vv. \\n \\n9/  If the beam does not have a cut-off with a clear \\\"elbow\\\", the lateral adjustment shall be \\neffected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for illumination at points 75 R and \\n50 R for right-hand traffic and for points  75 L and 50 L for left-hand traffic. \\n 10\\n/  Such a special \\\"passing beam\\\" headlamp ma y incorporate a driving beam not subject to \\nrequirements.

Where a headlamp so aimed does not meet the requirements set out in \\nparagraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and 6.3., its alignment may be changed, provided that the axis of the beam is not displ aced laterally by more than 1\\u00b0 (= 44 cm) \\nto the right or left. 11\\n/ To facilitate alignment by means of the \\\"cut-off\\\", the \\nheadlamp may be partially occulted in order to sharpen the \\\"cut-off\\\". \\n 6.2.5. The illumination produced on the screen by the passing beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements: \\n \\n6.2.6. There shall be no lateral va riations detrimental to good visibility in any of the \\nzones I, II, III and IV. \\n 6.2.7. The illumination values in zones \\\"A\\\" and \\\"B\\\" as shown in figure C in \\nAnnex 3 shall be checked by the measur ement of the photometric values of \\n                                                \\n \\n11/  The limit of realignment of 1\\u00b0 towards the right  or left is not incompatible with upward or \\ndownward vertical realig nment.

In the event that the principal light source fails, this additional light source shall be automatically switched off. \\n 6.2.10.3. In the event of failure of an addi tional light source, the headlamp shall \\ncontinue to fulfil the requirements of the passing beam. \\n 6.3. Provisions concerning driving beams\\n \\n 6.3.1. In the case of a headlamp designed to  provide a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, measurements of the illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall be taken with the same headlamp alignment as for measurements under paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. above; in the case of a \\nheadlamp providing a driving beam only, it shall be so adjusted that the area \\nof maximum illumination is centred on th e point of intersection of lines hh \\nand vv; such a headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in \\nparagraph 6.3. \\n 6.3.2.

REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING \\nNOTE: Refer to the test requirements of sect ions 4.1 and 4.1.4 of SAEJ1383 (APR85) for sample \\npreparation for applicable headlamp tests. \\n4.1  Sample Identification and Documentation \\n(a) The design responsible engineer for each part tested must sign a statement that must be \\nincluded in the test engineer's part certification report  that the parts and fixtures supplied for \\ntest are representative of the latest desi gn level approved for production, the device has been \\nmounted on the fixture in vehicle position us ing nominal design torque, and the device is \\napproved for testing. \\nNOTE: Not required for development,  non-certific ation DV tests, or in-process testing. \\n(b) For a headlamp used as a daytime running lamp , whether the lamp is exposed or concealed, \\ninclude the filament reduced voltage value, or, fo r a system that uses a DRL Module, provide \\na nominal module and part number. \\n(c) All parts being tested and related parts, i.e. sockets, which affect test results, must be \\nidentified by part number, including suffix, in the part drawing. Any deviation of test parts from \\nthose specified in the drawing must be documented by the design responsible engineer.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.  Issued:  6/24/98   Revised:  08/31/00   Revision Level 4.0 \\nCONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 80 11/4/2011 4.2. Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

Headlamps:  All bulbs used for photomet ric testing must have lower and/or upper \\nbeam filaments (if any) positioned within +/ - 0.125 mm (0.005 inch) axially, vertically \\nand horizontally of design location relative to  the lamp socket.  This specification is \\ntighter than is required by applicable regulations. \\n2. Non-Headlamps:  All replaceable, i.e.  non-sealed in lamp, bulbs must have the \\nfilaments (if any) positioned within +/- 0. 25 mm (0.010 inch) axially, vertically and \\nhorizontally of design location relative to the lamp, as specified in SAE J573d or by \\nthe bulb manufacturer.  \\nNOTE: This requirement derives fr om the FMVSS/CMVSS regulation which \\nreferences SAE J575e (Aug. 1980) (which references SAE J387). \\n \\n(b) Conditioning:  All bulbs used for photomet ric and wattage tests must be conditioned before \\nthe first use by operating at nominal design voltage for one percent of their average rated \\nlaboratory life.   \\n(c) On-Time: \\n1. Incandescent filament(s), allow a minimum of three minutes to stabilize the output of \\nthe bulb(s) prior to making maximum and minimum measurements. \\n2. Other light emitting devices, determi ne their performance characteristics in \\nrelationship to light output vs. time. Measur e and record the light output of the device \\nfor the worst case condition if significant changes in performance occur and document the duration of the on-time. \\n3. LED lighting devices, measure and reco rd the maximum output of the device \\nimmediately (within 60 sec.) after applying pow er to the device; allow internal heat \\nbuildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization time,  prior to measuring and recording individual test point data; and for the dust test, measure and record the maximum output of the device after internal heat bu ildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization \\ntime. \\nNOTE: This requirement der ives from SAE J1889 Oct93.

Use the \\nmirror on the slave fixture to reset t he horizontal zero. Mount the headlamp on \\nthe test fixture. \\nb) Adjust the vertical aim of t he \\\"VOR\\\" or \\\"VOL\\\" headlamp as follows: \\n1. Energize the low beam filament at 12.8 V DC and visually adjust the aim of \\nthe headlamp until the upper cutoff at 2 \\u00b0R is on the horizontal (0.0 \\u00b0D) for \\nVOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L is at 0.4 \\u00b0D for VOL . \\nThis aiming should be done on a test screen at least 25 feet from the lamp. \\n2. Fine tune the aim using the com puter software by scanning in  0.10 \\u00b0 \\nincrements from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to 1.5 \\u00b0 D at 2\\u00b0 R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL to \\ndetermine the point at which the maximum gradient occurs. \\nUse software or the following formula to find the maximum gradient: G=logE(a) - logE(a+0.1)           where G=gradient,  a=vetical angular position (degrees) , E(a)=candela. The maximum gradient must \\\"be not less than .13\\u2026\\\" otherwise record that the \\nCENTER GRADIENT FAILED.  \\n3. After finding the vertical location of the maximum gradient, the software/ \\noperator must set: a) the maximum gradient of VOR headlamps to be at the \\nvertical zero (0.0 \\u00b0D) of the goniometer, or b) the maximum gradient of VOL \\nheadlamps to be at 0.4D. \\n4.

Turn off all room lighting and the alignm ent laser if used to exclude extraneous light \\nfrom entering the area. \\n2. Supply power to the lower beam filam ent and adjust the voltage to the legally \\nrequired voltage (currently 12. 80 +/- .02 volts for U.S.) \\n3. Fill out any required forms and/or answer all computer entry fields. \\n4. The measurement system or test technician should locate and record the maximum \\ncandlepower reading and its location.  Posi tion the headlamp to the required test \\npositions and record the associated candlepower values for all test points  required by \\nany regulatory or other tables specified in  the test authorization, otherwise, use a \\ntable that seems appropriate.  The meas urements should use the \\u00bc reaim permitted \\nif a value exceeding the maximum is found. \\nNOTE: Where the 10U-90U area is specified  instead of a test point, the \\nmeasurement should be across the specifi ed horizontal line and up a vertical line \\nstarting on the horizontal line where the maximum intensity reading was \\nobtained.  These measurements should use the 1 degree reaim (2 degree cone) \\npermitted in Step 6 .  \\n5. Record the table number and standard,  i.e. FMVSS, CMVSS, F/CMVSS or SAE J \\nXXX and date, used as a Pass/Fail criteria on the data sheet.  Indicate whether the \\ndata  \\\"PASSED\\\" or FAILED\\\" all required acceptance criteria. \\nNOTE:  The following step, i.e. 6, must be  performed for: \\n1. all Certification tests where phot ometry evaluation is referenced, \\n2. but only for those DV tests in wh ich photometry is the only evaluation. \\nThe performance of Step 4 results in t he most upward glare region evaluation \\nbeing conducted with the commonly used interpretation, of measuring across an applicable  horizontal line and up a vertical  line at the point where the highest \\nreading on the applicable horizontal line wa s obtained.  This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6. Visually locate\\n within the region 10U to 90U - L to R any areas that are receiving \\nexcessively bright light. If such an area ex ists, scan the bright area to locate the \\napparent maximum intensity location and record the candlepower value and the position. Also record the candlepower va lue and position of all points within a 1 \\ndegree radius about the apparent maximum intensity location at 0.125 degree intervals. Find the actual highest intensity location by determining the center of the \\nhighest values obtained.  \\nActual highest intensity cd values that  are greater than 438 cd should be noted as \\nexceeding the maximum (FAIL), in addition, values exceeding 125 cd should also be \\nmarked as exceeding the maximum (FAIL), unless a 125 cd or lower value can be \\nfound within a 2 degree cone (1 degree reai m) around the actual highest intensity.  \\nNOTE:  The 2 degree cone is defined in  the rationale of  SAE J1383 JUN 90 and \\nalso in ECE R48 as the maximum area of spots of light that can exceed \\nthe maximum candlepower applied, i.e. 125 cd, to portions of the beam  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

NHTSA's Pat Boyd \\nannounced at the Fall 1997 SAE Lighting Committee meeting that the \\nrewrite of FMVSS 108 in 1998 will allow a maximum of 438 cd within a 2 \\ndegree cone for all low beam headlamps.  This was confirmed by \\nNHTSA's Rich Van Iderstine on 5/27/98 after he consulted with Pat \\nBoyd.  Therefore, this criteria can confidently be used for, at least, all \\nheadlamps that are for 1999 model vehicles or later.  \\n7.

The Product \\nEngineer must supply a pitch angle number and tolerance OR both upward and downward pitch angle numbers that he wants to certify the vehicle to.  The vehicle pitch number(s) submitted and used for testing should must be equal to or greater than the vehicle pitch number(s) of the vehicle approved fo r production.

Design voltage is the nominal voltage that t he vehicle will supply to the connector for the \\ncomponent.  North American Tail lamps are ty pically 14.0V and stop lamps are typically \\n12.8V.  However, ask the OEM to specify the nominal design voltage for the function \\nwhich could be different for the wiring, swit ching, resistors, voltage reduction modules \\netc. \\n  2. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage for 30 min, THEN run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with mi nimum requirements.   Also determine the \\nmaximum intensity location. \\n \\n3. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage and IMMEDIATELY run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with maxi mum requirements within 60 seconds, that is \\nbetween 0 and 60.49 seconds).   \\n \\n4. For lamps like CHMSLs with a maximum zone (10L to 10R and from 10U to 5D) (typically \\nalso equal to the furthest test points), test the PREDETERMINED maximum location \\nwithin the zone.  Give a 1/4 degree reaim to any test point or maximum intensity location \\nthat exceeds that maximum permitted candela.   Any test measurement which exceeds \\nthe maximum shall be remeasured at a time approaching, but not exceeding 60.49 \\nseconds, i.e. 50-60 seconds, since test meas urements taken it the earlier part of the \\nallotted 60 seconds, i.e., 0-10 or even at  10-20 seconds, may be higher than would be \\nobtained later in the allotted time period.  If multiple test points have maximums, it is \\npermitted to repeat the test at many times as  necessary to test all test points with \\nmaximums within the latter portion of the allotted time, i.e., 50-60 seconds. \\n \\n5. CHMSLs shall meet the photometric mini mums of FMVSS 108 Table 10; note the test \\npoint and zones are the same as SAEJ 1957 JUN 93, but the maximums are \\nDIFFERENT.  If the part meets only the FMVSS 108 table 10 and not either SAE J1889 \\nOct93 pr SAEJ1977 JUN 93, the function c ode marking letter(s) should be underlined on \\nthe part. \\n \\n6. In addition, locate the maximum candlepower, record the value and the location where it \\nwas obtained.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.

The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.  These bulbs are reca librated per G805-LL-C-001in accord with SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.8.3, except the annual recalibration has been replaced with a \\noperating time based calibration, which is  based on the interval recommended by the \\ncalibrating laboratory. \\n7. Note, that  there are filament or light source parameters that are not controlled in \\naccurate rated bulbs and these parameter s in \\\"some lighting devices may produce \\nsignificantly different luminous intensity measurements with two different accurate \\nrated bulbs, particularly lighting devices wi th particularly short focal lengths.\\\" SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.6). \\n8. The sensor/photometer system is desi gned and used within the guidelines for color \\nresponse, HID source use, range linearit y and sensor aperture size that are \\ncontained within SAE J1330 JUN94 sections 3. 7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3,  3.7.4 and 3.7.5.

PRODUCTION VALIDATION AND IN-PROCESS TESTS \\n  \\nA.  Certification Tests (C)\\n must be completed satisfactorily with parts from production tooling before PSW \\napproval and authorization of shipment of production part s.  If Certification tests cannot be performed with \\nparts from production tooling and production processes, PSW testing shall repeat Certification testing on \\nproduction parts with production processes. \\n \\nWhenever any change is made which could possibly aff ect part function of performance, the parts must be \\nrevalidated completely per Section III. The customer and Product Engineering must be informed that part certification could be affected.  \\n B.  PSW Tests\\n are used to demonstrate process capability and must be completed using initial production parts \\nfrom production tooling and processes prior to first produc tion shipment approval.  Tests are to continue in \\nuntil process capability is demonstrated. \\n C.   In-Process (IP) Tests\\n are used only after process capability has been established.  Tests must be completed \\nwith production parts on a continuing basis.  Sampli ng plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the \\nsignificant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan.  When the process is found to be out of control, or the test acceptance criterion are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan \\nshall be invoked. \\n  D.  Capacity Tests (CT)\\n shall be conducted to demonstrate tooling combination capability. 3 pieces in a row of \\neach lens/body cavity combination from production tooling must pass all test points on Low and High \\nBeam as indicated in the photometric criteria. \\n \\n III.

The filament lamp holder shall confor m to the characteristics given in IEC \\nPublication 61-2, third edit ion, 1969.  The holder data sheet relevant to the \\ncategory of filament lamp used, applies. \\n 5.6. Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic may be adapted for traffic on a given side of the road either by an \\nappropriate initial setting when fitted on the vehicle or by selective setting by \\nthe user. Such initial or selective setti ng may consist, for example, of fixing \\neither the optical unit at a given angle on the vehicle or the filament lamp at a \\ngiven angle in relation to the optical unit. In all cas es, only two different and \\nclearly distinct settings, one for right-h and and one for left-hand traffic, shall \\nbe possible, and the design shall pr eclude inadvertent shifting from one \\nsetting to the other or setting in an in termediate position. Where two different \\nsetting positions are provided for th e filament lamp, the components for \\nattaching the filament lamp to the re flector must be so designed and made \\n                                                \\n \\n6/  HIR1 and/or H9 filament lamps shall only be permitted to produce passing beam in \\nconjunction with the insta llation of headlamp cleani ng device(s) conforming to \\nRegulation No. 45.  In addition, with respect  to vertical inclin ation, the provision of \\nparagraph 6.2.6.2.2. of Regulation N o. 48, 01 series of amendments, shall not be applied when \\nthese lamps are installed. \\n  This restriction shall apply as long as there is no general agreement on the use of levelling \\ndevices and headlamp cleaners with respect to the level of the perfor mance of the headlamp. \\n7\\n/  A headlamp is regarded as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the filament lamp \\ncan be easily fitted into the headlamp and the pos itioning lugs can be correctly fitted into their \\nslots even in darkness.

Complementary tests shall be done acco rding to the requirements of Annex 4 \\nto ensure that in use there is no exce ssive change in photometric performance. \\n 5.8. If the lens of the headlamp is of plas tic material, tests sh all be done according \\nto the requirements of Annex 6. \\n 5.9. On headlamps designed to provide alte rnately a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, or a passing beam and/or a driv ing beam designed to become bend \\nlighting, any mechanical, el ectromechanical or other device incorporated in \\nthe headlamp for these purposes shall be so constructed that: \\n 5.9.1. the device is strong enough to with stand 50,000 operations without suffering \\ndamage despite the vibrations to whic h it may be subjected in normal use; \\n 5.9.2. in the case of failure the illumination above the line H-H shall not exceed the \\nvalues of a passing beam according to paragraph 6.2.5.; in addition, on headlamps designed to provide a passing and/or a driving beam to become a \\nbend lighting, a minimum illumination of at least 5 lux shall be fulfilled in test point 25 V (VV line, D 75 cm). \\n 5.9.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without \\nany possibility of the mechanis m stopping in between two positions; \\n 5.9.4. the user cannot, with ordi nary tools, change the shape or position of the \\nmoving parts. \\n 6. ILLUMINATION  6.1. General provisions\\n \\n 6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that th ey give adequate illumination without \\ndazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting the driving beam. \\n 6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of \\na vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its \\naxes as shown in Annex 3 to this Regulation. \\n 6.1.3. The headlamps shall be checked by mean s of an uncoloured standard (\\u00e9talon) \\nfilament lamp designed for a rated volta ge of 12 V.  During the checking of  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 15   \\n \\n the headlamp, the voltage at the terminals of the filament lamp shall be \\nregulated so as to obtain the refere nce luminous flux as indicated at the \\nrelevant data sheet of Regulation No. 37. \\n 6.1.4. The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of \\nthis paragraph 6 with at least one sta ndard (\\u00e9talon) filament lamp, which may \\nbe submitted with the headlamp. \\n 6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:  6.2.2.1. in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand \\ntraffic, the \\\"cut-off\\\" on the left-half of the screen 8\\n/ is horizontal and, in the \\ncase of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left -hand traffic, the \\n\\\"cut-off\\\" on the right-half of the screen is horizontal; \\n 6.2.2.2. this horizontal part of the \\\"cut-off\\\" is  situated on the sc reen 25 cm below the \\nlevel hh (see Annex 3);  \\n \\n6.2.2.3. the \\\"elbow\\\" of the \\\"c ut-off\\\" is on line vv. 9\\n/ \\n 6.2.3. When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely for \\nprovision of a passing beam, 10\\n/ comply only with the requirements set out in  \\n                                                 \\n8/  The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the \\\"cut-off\\\" over a range of \\nat least 5\\u00b0 on either side of the line vv. \\n \\n9/  If the beam does not have a cut-off with a clear \\\"elbow\\\", the lateral adjustment shall be \\neffected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for illumination at points 75 R and \\n50 R for right-hand traffic and for points  75 L and 50 L for left-hand traffic. \\n 10\\n/  Such a special \\\"passing beam\\\" headlamp ma y incorporate a driving beam not subject to \\nrequirements.

Where a headlamp so aimed does not meet the requirements set out in \\nparagraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and 6.3., its alignment may be changed, provided that the axis of the beam is not displ aced laterally by more than 1\\u00b0 (= 44 cm) \\nto the right or left. 11\\n/ To facilitate alignment by means of the \\\"cut-off\\\", the \\nheadlamp may be partially occulted in order to sharpen the \\\"cut-off\\\". \\n 6.2.5. The illumination produced on the screen by the passing beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements: \\n \\n6.2.6. There shall be no lateral va riations detrimental to good visibility in any of the \\nzones I, II, III and IV. \\n 6.2.7.

In the case of a headlamp designed to  provide a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, measurements of the illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall be taken with the same headlamp alignment as for measurements under paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. above; in the case of a \\nheadlamp providing a driving beam only, it shall be so adjusted that the area \\nof maximum illumination is centred on th e point of intersection of lines hh \\nand vv; such a headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in \\nparagraph 6.3. \\n 6.3.2. It is possible to use several light sources for the driving beam.  6.3.3. The illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements. \\n 6.3.3.1. The point of intersection (HV) of lines hh and vv shall be si tuated within the \\nisolux 80 per cent of maximum illumination. This maximum value (E\\nM) shall \\nnot be less than 32 lux for Class A headlamps and 48 lux for Class B \\nheadlamps.  The maximum value shall in no circumstances exceed 240 lux; in \\naddition, in the case of a combined passing and driving headlamp, this \\nmaximum value shall not be more than  16 times the illumination measured for \\nthe passing beam at point 75 R (or 75 L). \\n 6.3.3.1.1. The maximum intensity (I\\nM) of the driving beam e xpressed in thousands of \\ncandelas shall be calculated by the formula: \\n  I\\nM = 0.625 E M \\n 6.3.3.1.2. The reference mark (I\\n'\\nM) of this maximum intensity, referred to in \\nparagraph 4.2.2.7. above, shall be obtained by the ratio: \\n \\n  \\n \\n I'I\\n30.208  EMM\\nM == E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 19   \\n \\n This value shall be rounded off to the value 7.5 - 10 - 12.5 - 17.5 - 20 - 25 - \\n27.5 - 30 - 37.5 - 40 - 45 - 50. \\n 6.3.3.2. Starting from point HV, horizontally to  the right and left, the illumination \\nshall be not less than 16 lux for Cl ass A headlamp and 24 lux for Class B \\nheadlamp up to a distance of 1.125 m a nd not less than 4 lux for Class A \\nheadlamp and 6 lux for Class B h eadlamp up to a di stance of 2.25 m. \\n 6.4. In the case of headlamps with adju stable reflector the requirements of \\nparagraphs 6.2. and 6.3. are applicable for each mounting position indicated according to paragraph 2.1.3.  For verifi cation the following procedure shall \\nbe used: \\n 6.4.1. Each applied position is realized on the test goniometer with respect to a line \\njoining the centre of the light source  and point HV on a aiming screen.  The \\nadjustable reflector is then moved into such a position that the light pattern on \\nthe screen corresponds to the aiming pr escriptions of paragraphs 6.2.1. to \\n6.2.2.3. and/or 6.3.1; \\n 6.4.2. with the reflector initially fixed acco rding to paragraph 6.4.1., the headlamp \\nmust meet the relevant photometric re quirements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3; \\n \\n6.4.3. additional tests are made after the reflector has been moved vertically \\u00b1 2\\u00b0 or \\nat least into the maximum position, if less than 2\\u00b0, from its initial position by \\nmeans of the headlamps adjusting device. Having re-aimed the headlamp as a whole (by means of the goniometer fo r example) in the corresponding \\nopposite direction the light output in the following directions shall be \\ncontrolled and lie within the required limits: \\n \\npassing beam : points HV and 75 R (75 L respectively); driving beam : E\\nM and point HV (percentage of E M). \\n \\n6.4.4. if the applicant has not indicated more than one mounting position,  the \\nprocedure of paragraphs 6.4.1. to 6.4.3. shall be repeated for all other \\npositions; \\n 6.4.5. if the applicant has no t asked for special mounti ng positions, the headlamp \\nshall be aimed for measurements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3. with the \\nheadlamps adjusting device in its m ean position.  The additional test of \\nparagraph 6.4.3. shall be made with the reflector moved into its extreme positions (instead of \\n+ 2\\u00b0) by means of the headlamps adjusting device. \\n 6.5. The screen illumination values mentioned in paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and \\n6.3. above shall be measured by means of a photo receptor, the effective area of which shall be contained within a square of 65 mm side.

TESTING TO ECE REGULATIONS AND OT HER NON-U.S. OR CANADIAN REGULATIONS   \\nTesting to ECE European regulations and other NON- U.S. OR CANADIAN regulations is generally \\nperformed to the specific instructions included within  the regulation.  Applicable ECE regulations are \\nlisted in Section 10 REFERENCES.  Testing for ot her markets should be performed according to their \\nspecific regulations which should be obt ained from WISE or from the customer. \\nWhen interpretations are required Test Technicians  or Test Engineers should consult the Regulatory \\nCompliance Engineer so that any interpretations  can have both a consensus and legal basis.  The \\nRegulatory Compliance Engineer should ensure that in terpretations are recorded for future use.  \\nInterpretations that are deemed significant will be incorporated in revisions to this document  \\nNOTE:  Sections 5, 6 and 7 as written specifica lly to cover the U.S./Canadian legal requirements. \\nOther sections are applicable to foreign requirem ents, except where foreign requirements impose \\neither contradictory or additional requirements.

REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING \\nNOTE: Refer to the test requirements of sect ions 4.1 and 4.1.4 of SAEJ1383 (APR85) for sample \\npreparation for applicable headlamp tests. \\n4.1  Sample Identification and Documentation \\n(a) The design responsible engineer for each part tested must sign a statement that must be \\nincluded in the test engineer's part certification report  that the parts and fixtures supplied for \\ntest are representative of the latest desi gn level approved for production, the device has been \\nmounted on the fixture in vehicle position us ing nominal design torque, and the device is \\napproved for testing. \\nNOTE: Not required for development,  non-certific ation DV tests, or in-process testing. \\n(b) For a headlamp used as a daytime running lamp , whether the lamp is exposed or concealed, \\ninclude the filament reduced voltage value, or, fo r a system that uses a DRL Module, provide \\na nominal module and part number. \\n(c) All parts being tested and related parts, i.e. sockets, which affect test results, must be \\nidentified by part number, including suffix, in the part drawing. Any deviation of test parts from \\nthose specified in the drawing must be documented by the design responsible engineer.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.  Issued:  6/24/98   Revised:  08/31/00   Revision Level 4.0 \\nCONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 80 11/4/2011 4.2. Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

The meas urements should use the \\u00bc reaim permitted \\nif a value exceeding the maximum is found. \\nNOTE: Where the 10U-90U area is specified  instead of a test point, the \\nmeasurement should be across the specifi ed horizontal line and up a vertical line \\nstarting on the horizontal line where the maximum intensity reading was \\nobtained.  These measurements should use the 1 degree reaim (2 degree cone) \\npermitted in Step 6 .  \\n5.

This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6. Visually locate\\n within the region 10U to 90U - L to R any areas that are receiving \\nexcessively bright light.

Also record the candlepower va lue and position of all points within a 1 \\ndegree radius about the apparent maximum intensity location at 0.125 degree intervals. Find the actual highest intensity location by determining the center of the \\nhighest values obtained.  \\nActual highest intensity cd values that  are greater than 438 cd should be noted as \\nexceeding the maximum (FAIL), in addition, values exceeding 125 cd should also be \\nmarked as exceeding the maximum (FAIL), unless a 125 cd or lower value can be \\nfound within a 2 degree cone (1 degree reai m) around the actual highest intensity.  \\nNOTE:  The 2 degree cone is defined in  the rationale of  SAE J1383 JUN 90 and \\nalso in ECE R48 as the maximum area of spots of light that can exceed \\nthe maximum candlepower applied, i.e. 125 cd, to portions of the beam  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

Design voltage is the nominal voltage that t he vehicle will supply to the connector for the \\ncomponent.  North American Tail lamps are ty pically 14.0V and stop lamps are typically \\n12.8V.  However, ask the OEM to specify the nominal design voltage for the function \\nwhich could be different for the wiring, swit ching, resistors, voltage reduction modules \\netc. \\n  2. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage for 30 min, THEN run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with mi nimum requirements.   Also determine the \\nmaximum intensity location. \\n \\n3. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage and IMMEDIATELY run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with maxi mum requirements within 60 seconds, that is \\nbetween 0 and 60.49 seconds).   \\n \\n4. For lamps like CHMSLs with a maximum zone (10L to 10R and from 10U to 5D) (typically \\nalso equal to the furthest test points), test the PREDETERMINED maximum location \\nwithin the zone.  Give a 1/4 degree reaim to any test point or maximum intensity location \\nthat exceeds that maximum permitted candela.   Any test measurement which exceeds \\nthe maximum shall be remeasured at a time approaching, but not exceeding 60.49 \\nseconds, i.e. 50-60 seconds, since test meas urements taken it the earlier part of the \\nallotted 60 seconds, i.e., 0-10 or even at  10-20 seconds, may be higher than would be \\nobtained later in the allotted time period.  If multiple test points have maximums, it is \\npermitted to repeat the test at many times as  necessary to test all test points with \\nmaximums within the latter portion of the allotted time, i.e., 50-60 seconds. \\n \\n5.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.

The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.

GENERAL  PURPOSE - to define the functional and environmental requirements necessary to confirm part functionality and durability and to describe the test methods necessary to evaluate these requirements. \\n This exterior lamp engineering specification is a supplem ent to the released drawing and all requirements herein \\nmust be met in addition to those specifically detailed on the part drawing.  This specification pertains to components which must be designed to comply with FMVSS/CMVSS 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment:  \\na.  Replaceable bulb headlamp assemblies\\n. \\nThe replaceable bulb headlamp consists of a lens, hous ing, reflector, replaceable light source, light source \\nretaining ring/cap, and attaching hardware.  Its function is to provide forward vehicle illumination.  The headlamp must be designed to comply with FMVSS/CMVSS 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment. \\n B.  All exterior lamp and reflex reflector assemblies.\\n \\nA signal and/or marking lamp consis ts of a lens, housing, reflector, re placeable light source, and attaching \\nhardware and may include a reflex re flector.  A reflex reflector may be its own molded piece of plastic and \\nits attaching hardware.  These components function  to  provide signaling and/or marking either by a light \\nsource or reflected light.. \\n Submission of an acceptable CONTROL PLAN is the responsibility of the manufacturing source.  The \\nmanufacturing source will retain the orig inal of the approved Control Plan a nd any later revisions per QS 9000 and \\nprovide a copy to the design responsible activity which must  approve the control plan prior to PSW approval.  The \\nengineering test program outlined by th e control plan is intended as a suppl ement to normal material inspections, \\ndimensional checking and in-process controls.

PRODUCTION VALIDATION AND IN-PROCESS TESTS \\n  \\nA.  Certification Tests (C)\\n must be completed satisfactorily with parts from production tooling before PSW \\napproval and authorization of shipment of production part s.  If Certification tests cannot be performed with \\nparts from production tooling and production processes, PSW testing shall repeat Certification testing on \\nproduction parts with production processes. \\n \\nWhenever any change is made which could possibly aff ect part function of performance, the parts must be \\nrevalidated completely per Section III. The customer and Product Engineering must be informed that part certification could be affected.  \\n B.  PSW Tests\\n are used to demonstrate process capability and must be completed using initial production parts \\nfrom production tooling and processes prior to first produc tion shipment approval.  Tests are to continue in \\nuntil process capability is demonstrated. \\n C.   In-Process (IP) Tests\\n are used only after process capability has been established.  Tests must be completed \\nwith production parts on a continuing basis.  Sampli ng plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the \\nsignificant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan.  When the process is found to be out of control, or the test acceptance criterion are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan \\nshall be invoked. \\n  D.  Capacity Tests (CT)\\n shall be conducted to demonstrate tooling combination capability. 3 pieces in a row of \\neach lens/body cavity combination from production tooling must pass all test points on Low and High \\nBeam as indicated in the photometric criteria. \\n \\n III.

GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS \\n \\n5.1. Each sample shall conform to the specifi cations set forth in paragraphs 6 to 8 \\nbelow. \\n 5.2. Headlamps shall be so made as to  retain their prescribed photometric \\ncharacteristics and to remain in good working order when in normal use, in spite of the vibrations to which they may be subjected. \\n 5.2.1. Headlamps shall be fitted with a device enabling them to be so adjusted on the \\nvehicles as to comply with the rules applicable to them.  Such a device need not be fitted on units in wh ich the reflector and the diffusing lens cannot be \\nseparated, provided the use of such units is confined to vehicles on which the \\nheadlamp setting can be adjusted by other means.  \\n \\n                                                \\n \\n5/  Technical requirements for fila ment lamps: see Regulation No. 37.

However, these provisions shall not apply to headlamp assemblies whose \\nreflectors are indivisible. For this t ype of assembly the requirements of \\nparagraph 6.3. of this Regulation apply. \\n 5.3. The headlamp shall be equipped with filament lamp(s) approved according to \\nRegulation No. 37.  Any Regulation N o. 37 filament lamp may be used, \\nprovided that no restriction on the applica tion is made in the table of contents \\nof Regulation No. 37. 6\\n/ \\n 5.4. The components by which a filament lamp is fixed to the reflector shall be so \\nmade that, even in darkness, the filament lamp can be fixed in no position but the correct one. 7\\n/ \\n 5.5. The filament lamp holder shall confor m to the characteristics given in IEC \\nPublication 61-2, third edit ion, 1969.  The holder data sheet relevant to the \\ncategory of filament lamp used, applies. \\n 5.6. Headlamps designed to satisfy the requi rements both of right-hand and of left-\\nhand traffic may be adapted for traffic on a given side of the road either by an \\nappropriate initial setting when fitted on the vehicle or by selective setting by \\nthe user. Such initial or selective setti ng may consist, for example, of fixing \\neither the optical unit at a given angle on the vehicle or the filament lamp at a \\ngiven angle in relation to the optical unit. In all cas es, only two different and \\nclearly distinct settings, one for right-h and and one for left-hand traffic, shall \\nbe possible, and the design shall pr eclude inadvertent shifting from one \\nsetting to the other or setting in an in termediate position. Where two different \\nsetting positions are provided for th e filament lamp, the components for \\nattaching the filament lamp to the re flector must be so designed and made \\n                                                \\n \\n6/  HIR1 and/or H9 filament lamps shall only be permitted to produce passing beam in \\nconjunction with the insta llation of headlamp cleani ng device(s) conforming to \\nRegulation No. 45.  In addition, with respect  to vertical inclin ation, the provision of \\nparagraph 6.2.6.2.2. of Regulation N o. 48, 01 series of amendments, shall not be applied when \\nthese lamps are installed. \\n  This restriction shall apply as long as there is no general agreement on the use of levelling \\ndevices and headlamp cleaners with respect to the level of the perfor mance of the headlamp. \\n7\\n/  A headlamp is regarded as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the filament lamp \\ncan be easily fitted into the headlamp and the pos itioning lugs can be correctly fitted into their \\nslots even in darkness.

Complementary tests shall be done acco rding to the requirements of Annex 4 \\nto ensure that in use there is no exce ssive change in photometric performance. \\n 5.8. If the lens of the headlamp is of plas tic material, tests sh all be done according \\nto the requirements of Annex 6. \\n 5.9. On headlamps designed to provide alte rnately a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, or a passing beam and/or a driv ing beam designed to become bend \\nlighting, any mechanical, el ectromechanical or other device incorporated in \\nthe headlamp for these purposes shall be so constructed that: \\n 5.9.1. the device is strong enough to with stand 50,000 operations without suffering \\ndamage despite the vibrations to whic h it may be subjected in normal use; \\n 5.9.2. in the case of failure the illumination above the line H-H shall not exceed the \\nvalues of a passing beam according to paragraph 6.2.5.; in addition, on headlamps designed to provide a passing and/or a driving beam to become a \\nbend lighting, a minimum illumination of at least 5 lux shall be fulfilled in test point 25 V (VV line, D 75 cm). \\n 5.9.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without \\nany possibility of the mechanis m stopping in between two positions; \\n 5.9.4. the user cannot, with ordi nary tools, change the shape or position of the \\nmoving parts. \\n 6. ILLUMINATION  6.1. General provisions\\n \\n 6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that th ey give adequate illumination without \\ndazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting the driving beam. \\n 6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of \\na vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its \\naxes as shown in Annex 3 to this Regulation. \\n 6.1.3. The headlamps shall be checked by mean s of an uncoloured standard (\\u00e9talon) \\nfilament lamp designed for a rated volta ge of 12 V.  During the checking of  E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 15   \\n \\n the headlamp, the voltage at the terminals of the filament lamp shall be \\nregulated so as to obtain the refere nce luminous flux as indicated at the \\nrelevant data sheet of Regulation No. 37. \\n 6.1.4. The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of \\nthis paragraph 6 with at least one sta ndard (\\u00e9talon) filament lamp, which may \\nbe submitted with the headlamp. \\n 6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams\\n \\n 6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a suffi ciently sharp \\\"cut-off\\\" to permit a \\nsatisfactory adjustment with its aid. The \\\"cut-off\\\" must be a horizontal \\nstraight line on the side oppos ite to the direction of the traffic for which the \\nheadlamp is intended; on the other side, it must not extend beyond either the broken line HV H\\n1 H4 formed by a straight line HV H 1 making a 45\\u00b0 angle \\nwith the horizontal and the straight line H 1 H4, 25 cm above the straight \\nline hh, or the straight line HV H 3, inclined at an angle of 15\\u00b0 above the \\nhorizontal (see Annex 3).  A cut- off extending beyond both line HV H 2 and \\nline H 2 H4 and resulting from a combinati on of the two above possibilities \\nshall in no circumstances be permitted. \\n 6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:  6.2.2.1. in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand \\ntraffic, the \\\"cut-off\\\" on the left-half of the screen 8\\n/ is horizontal and, in the \\ncase of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left -hand traffic, the \\n\\\"cut-off\\\" on the right-half of the screen is horizontal; \\n 6.2.2.2. this horizontal part of the \\\"cut-off\\\" is  situated on the sc reen 25 cm below the \\nlevel hh (see Annex 3);  \\n \\n6.2.2.3. the \\\"elbow\\\" of the \\\"c ut-off\\\" is on line vv. 9\\n/ \\n 6.2.3. When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely for \\nprovision of a passing beam, 10\\n/ comply only with the requirements set out in  \\n                                                 \\n8/  The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the \\\"cut-off\\\" over a range of \\nat least 5\\u00b0 on either side of the line vv. \\n \\n9/  If the beam does not have a cut-off with a clear \\\"elbow\\\", the lateral adjustment shall be \\neffected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for illumination at points 75 R and \\n50 R for right-hand traffic and for points  75 L and 50 L for left-hand traffic. \\n 10\\n/  Such a special \\\"passing beam\\\" headlamp ma y incorporate a driving beam not subject to \\nrequirements.

Where a headlamp so aimed does not meet the requirements set out in \\nparagraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and 6.3., its alignment may be changed, provided that the axis of the beam is not displ aced laterally by more than 1\\u00b0 (= 44 cm) \\nto the right or left. 11\\n/ To facilitate alignment by means of the \\\"cut-off\\\", the \\nheadlamp may be partially occulted in order to sharpen the \\\"cut-off\\\". \\n 6.2.5. The illumination produced on the screen by the passing beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements: \\n \\n6.2.6. There shall be no lateral va riations detrimental to good visibility in any of the \\nzones I, II, III and IV. \\n 6.2.7. The illumination values in zones \\\"A\\\" and \\\"B\\\" as shown in figure C in \\nAnnex 3 shall be checked by the measur ement of the photometric values of \\n                                                \\n \\n11/  The limit of realignment of 1\\u00b0 towards the right  or left is not incompatible with upward or \\ndownward vertical realig nment.  The latter is limited only by the requirements of paragraph 6.3. \\nHowever, the horizontal part of the \\\"cut -off\\\" should not extend beyond the line hh \\n(the provisions of paragra ph 6.3. are not applicable to h eadlamps intended to meet the \\nrequirements of this Regulation only for provision of a passing beam).

The requirements in paragraph 6.2.5. above shall also ap ply to headlamps \\ndesigned to provide bend lighting and/or  that include the additional light \\nsource referred to in paragraph 6.2.10.2. \\n 6.2.9.1. If bend lighting is obtained by:  6.2.9.1.1. swivelling the passing beam or moving horizontally the kink  of the elbow of \\nthe cut-off, the measurements shall be carried out after the complete \\nheadlamp assembly has been reai med horizontally, e.g. by means of a \\ngoniometer; \\n 6.2.9.1.2. moving one or more optical parts of the headlamp without moving \\nhorizontally the kink of the elbow of the cut-off, measurements shall be \\ncarried out with these parts being in their extreme operating position; \\n \\n6.2.9.1.3. means of one additional light source without moving horizontally the kink of \\nthe elbow of the cut-off, measurements shall be carried out with this light \\nsource activated. \\n 6.2.10. Only one principal light source is pe rmitted for each passing beam headlamp.  \\nHowever, a maximum of two additional light sources are permitted as follows: \\n 6.2.10.1. One additional light source inside the passing beam headlamp according to \\nRegulation No. 37 may be used to  contribute to  bend lighting. \\n \\n                                                \\n \\n12/  Illumination values in any point of zones A a nd B, which also lies within zone III, shall not \\nexceed 0.7 lux.

One additional light source according to Regulation No. 37, inside the passing \\nbeam headlamp, may be used for the purposes of generating infrared radiation.  It shall only be activated at  the same time as the principal light \\nsource.  In the event that the principal light source fails, this additional light source shall be automatically switched off. \\n 6.2.10.3. In the event of failure of an addi tional light source, the headlamp shall \\ncontinue to fulfil the requirements of the passing beam. \\n 6.3. Provisions concerning driving beams\\n \\n 6.3.1. In the case of a headlamp designed to  provide a driving beam and a passing \\nbeam, measurements of the illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall be taken with the same headlamp alignment as for measurements under paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. above; in the case of a \\nheadlamp providing a driving beam only, it shall be so adjusted that the area \\nof maximum illumination is centred on th e point of intersection of lines hh \\nand vv; such a headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in \\nparagraph 6.3. \\n 6.3.2. It is possible to use several light sources for the driving beam.  6.3.3. The illumination produced on the screen by the driving beam shall meet the \\nfollowing requirements. \\n 6.3.3.1. The point of intersection (HV) of lines hh and vv shall be si tuated within the \\nisolux 80 per cent of maximum illumination. This maximum value (E\\nM) shall \\nnot be less than 32 lux for Class A headlamps and 48 lux for Class B \\nheadlamps.  The maximum value shall in no circumstances exceed 240 lux; in \\naddition, in the case of a combined passing and driving headlamp, this \\nmaximum value shall not be more than  16 times the illumination measured for \\nthe passing beam at point 75 R (or 75 L). \\n 6.3.3.1.1. The maximum intensity (I\\nM) of the driving beam e xpressed in thousands of \\ncandelas shall be calculated by the formula: \\n  I\\nM = 0.625 E M \\n 6.3.3.1.2. The reference mark (I\\n'\\nM) of this maximum intensity, referred to in \\nparagraph 4.2.2.7. above, shall be obtained by the ratio: \\n \\n  \\n \\n I'I\\n30.208  EMM\\nM == E/ECE/324 \\nE/ECE/TRANS/505} Rev.2/Add.111/Rev.1 \\nRegulation No. 112 \\npage 19   \\n \\n This value shall be rounded off to the value 7.5 - 10 - 12.5 - 17.5 - 20 - 25 - \\n27.5 - 30 - 37.5 - 40 - 45 - 50. \\n 6.3.3.2.

In the case of headlamps with adju stable reflector the requirements of \\nparagraphs 6.2. and 6.3. are applicable for each mounting position indicated according to paragraph 2.1.3.  For verifi cation the following procedure shall \\nbe used: \\n 6.4.1. Each applied position is realized on the test goniometer with respect to a line \\njoining the centre of the light source  and point HV on a aiming screen.  The \\nadjustable reflector is then moved into such a position that the light pattern on \\nthe screen corresponds to the aiming pr escriptions of paragraphs 6.2.1. to \\n6.2.2.3. and/or 6.3.1; \\n 6.4.2. with the reflector initially fixed acco rding to paragraph 6.4.1., the headlamp \\nmust meet the relevant photometric re quirements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3; \\n \\n6.4.3. additional tests are made after the reflector has been moved vertically \\u00b1 2\\u00b0 or \\nat least into the maximum position, if less than 2\\u00b0, from its initial position by \\nmeans of the headlamps adjusting device. Having re-aimed the headlamp as a whole (by means of the goniometer fo r example) in the corresponding \\nopposite direction the light output in the following directions shall be \\ncontrolled and lie within the required limits: \\n \\npassing beam : points HV and 75 R (75 L respectively); driving beam : E\\nM and point HV (percentage of E M). \\n \\n6.4.4. if the applicant has not indicated more than one mounting position,  the \\nprocedure of paragraphs 6.4.1. to 6.4.3. shall be repeated for all other \\npositions; \\n 6.4.5. if the applicant has no t asked for special mounti ng positions, the headlamp \\nshall be aimed for measurements of paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3. with the \\nheadlamps adjusting device in its m ean position.  The additional test of \\nparagraph 6.4.3. shall be made with the reflector moved into its extreme positions (instead of \\n+ 2\\u00b0) by means of the headlamps adjusting device. \\n 6.5. The screen illumination values mentioned in paragraphs 6.2.5. to 6.2.7. and \\n6.3. above shall be measured by means of a photo receptor, the effective area of which shall be contained within a square of 65 mm side.

REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING \\nNOTE: Refer to the test requirements of sect ions 4.1 and 4.1.4 of SAEJ1383 (APR85) for sample \\npreparation for applicable headlamp tests. \\n4.1  Sample Identification and Documentation \\n(a) The design responsible engineer for each part tested must sign a statement that must be \\nincluded in the test engineer's part certification report  that the parts and fixtures supplied for \\ntest are representative of the latest desi gn level approved for production, the device has been \\nmounted on the fixture in vehicle position us ing nominal design torque, and the device is \\napproved for testing. \\nNOTE: Not required for development,  non-certific ation DV tests, or in-process testing. \\n(b) For a headlamp used as a daytime running lamp , whether the lamp is exposed or concealed, \\ninclude the filament reduced voltage value, or, fo r a system that uses a DRL Module, provide \\na nominal module and part number. \\n(c) All parts being tested and related parts, i.e. sockets, which affect test results, must be \\nidentified by part number, including suffix, in the part drawing. Any deviation of test parts from \\nthose specified in the drawing must be documented by the design responsible engineer.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

Test Fixture Preparation and Recalibration \\n(a) To ensure that the test fixtures and mount ing arrangement are correct for the vehicle or \\ncomponent tested, the test technician  must examine the test setup and provide \\ndocumentation, including test fixture identific ation by number or description.  The Test \\nTechnician is responsible for noting and record ing any observed deviations from the required \\ntest setup . \\n(b) Components shall be mounted with nominal design torque. (c) Test fixtures shall be design by Pr oduct Engineering to comply with G805WI-013\\n. The \\nsupplier of the fixture should properly identify the fixture and the date of the drawing. Since \\nno changes in these fixtures have been noted over  extended periods, that were equal to or \\ngreater than the duration between Job1 and 10 y ears after last model production, no re-\\ncalibration, via CMM or other means, is nec essary, unless the fixture has observable \\ndamage.  \\n(d) If a fixture has observed damage that coul d affect measurement accuracy or test \\nperformance, notify the Product Engineer to hav e it re-calibrated by CMM or equivalent \\nmeans.  Any re-calibration data must be available to  substantiate the accuracy of the fixture.  \\nThe re-calibration data should be stored in the l ab or with the fixture coordinator with the \\nlayout drawing of each fixture that must be available with CMM data to substantiate the \\naccuracy of the fixture.  \\n(e) For high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must be designed to accommodate all \\nequipment within the horizontal to 5 degree plane down and rearward line (e.g., spoiler, \\nluggage rack, rear deck, etc.).  For interior high-mounted stop lamps, the test fixture must \\naccommodate the rear glazing and any component (e.g., electric defroster, wiper, washer, \\netc.) which may obstruct the signal.  During te sting, moving components will be in the design-\\noff position.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.

Headlamps:  All bulbs used for photomet ric testing must have lower and/or upper \\nbeam filaments (if any) positioned within +/ - 0.125 mm (0.005 inch) axially, vertically \\nand horizontally of design location relative to  the lamp socket.  This specification is \\ntighter than is required by applicable regulations. \\n2. Non-Headlamps:  All replaceable, i.e.  non-sealed in lamp, bulbs must have the \\nfilaments (if any) positioned within +/- 0. 25 mm (0.010 inch) axially, vertically and \\nhorizontally of design location relative to the lamp, as specified in SAE J573d or by \\nthe bulb manufacturer.  \\nNOTE: This requirement derives fr om the FMVSS/CMVSS regulation which \\nreferences SAE J575e (Aug. 1980) (which references SAE J387). \\n \\n(b) Conditioning:  All bulbs used for photomet ric and wattage tests must be conditioned before \\nthe first use by operating at nominal design voltage for one percent of their average rated \\nlaboratory life.   \\n(c) On-Time: \\n1. Incandescent filament(s), allow a minimum of three minutes to stabilize the output of \\nthe bulb(s) prior to making maximum and minimum measurements. \\n2. Other light emitting devices, determi ne their performance characteristics in \\nrelationship to light output vs. time. Measur e and record the light output of the device \\nfor the worst case condition if significant changes in performance occur and document the duration of the on-time. \\n3. LED lighting devices, measure and reco rd the maximum output of the device \\nimmediately (within 60 sec.) after applying pow er to the device; allow internal heat \\nbuildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization time,  prior to measuring and recording individual test point data; and for the dust test, measure and record the maximum output of the device after internal heat bu ildup saturation or 30 minutes stabilization \\ntime. \\nNOTE: This requirement der ives from SAE J1889 Oct93.

The \\n1/4 degree re-aim (tolerance of 0.25 degrees) is  considered to mean within a cone with a \\n1/4 degree radius . \\n5.1.1. Low-Beam Photometry \\n(a) Mount the alignment test fixture on the loca ting pins of the goniometer, with the low beam \\nfocal point at the center.  Adjust the height  of the goniometer so that the sample\\u2019s \\nmechanical axis is the same height as the photodetector. \\n(b) Rotate the goniometer to the aiming plane position. (c) Aim the Low Beam using the appropriate headlamp aim system from (c) 1), 2),  3) or 4)  \\n1.

Use the \\nmirror on the slave fixture to reset t he horizontal zero. Mount the headlamp on \\nthe test fixture. \\nb) Adjust the vertical aim of t he \\\"VOR\\\" or \\\"VOL\\\" headlamp as follows: \\n1. Energize the low beam filament at 12.8 V DC and visually adjust the aim of \\nthe headlamp until the upper cutoff at 2 \\u00b0R is on the horizontal (0.0 \\u00b0D) for \\nVOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L is at 0.4 \\u00b0D for VOL . \\nThis aiming should be done on a test screen at least 25 feet from the lamp. \\n2. Fine tune the aim using the com puter software by scanning in  0.10 \\u00b0 \\nincrements from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to 1.5 \\u00b0 D at 2\\u00b0 R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL to \\ndetermine the point at which the maximum gradient occurs. \\nUse software or the following formula to find the maximum gradient: G=logE(a) - logE(a+0.1)           where G=gradient,  a=vetical angular position (degrees) , E(a)=candela. The maximum gradient must \\\"be not less than .13\\u2026\\\" otherwise record that the \\nCENTER GRADIENT FAILED.  \\n3. After finding the vertical location of the maximum gradient, the software/ \\noperator must set: a) the maximum gradient of VOR headlamps to be at the \\nvertical zero (0.0 \\u00b0D) of the goniometer, or b) the maximum gradient of VOL \\nheadlamps to be at 0.4D. \\n4. Scan in  0.10 \\u00b0 increments from 1.5 \\u00b0 U to1.5\\u00b0 D at the locations: 1 \\u00b0R and 3\\u00b0R \\nfor VOR (i.e., the ends of minimum width) and 1.5\\u00b0L and 3.5 \\u00b0L for VOL (i.e., \\nthe ends of minimum width) to determine the maximum gradients (or \\ninclinations) at these locations.  \\n5. If  the maximum gradients measured at : 1\\u00b0R and 3\\u00b0R for VOR and 1.5 \\u00b0L and \\n3.5\\u00b0L for VOL are not vertically within +/- 0.2 \\u00b0of the maximum gradients  at: \\n2\\u00b0R for VOR or 2.5 \\u00b0L for VOL,  record that the END GRADIENT FAILED AT \\nand specify the horizontal angle . \\n6. If the gradients at the ends of the mi nimum width are within the required +/- \\n0.2, then Go to step 5.1.1.(d) Low beam Measurement.  \\nNOTE: In the future multiple light sources may be permitted, if they are \\nlegal and required by a particular design and some sources are independently adjustable in relation to the first, repeat the previous steps for the additional independently aimable light sources. \\n4.

Fill out any required forms and/or answer all computer entry fields. \\n4. The measurement system or test technician should locate and record the maximum \\ncandlepower reading and its location.  Posi tion the headlamp to the required test \\npositions and record the associated candlepower values for all test points  required by \\nany regulatory or other tables specified in  the test authorization, otherwise, use a \\ntable that seems appropriate.  The meas urements should use the \\u00bc reaim permitted \\nif a value exceeding the maximum is found. \\nNOTE: Where the 10U-90U area is specified  instead of a test point, the \\nmeasurement should be across the specifi ed horizontal line and up a vertical line \\nstarting on the horizontal line where the maximum intensity reading was \\nobtained.  These measurements should use the 1 degree reaim (2 degree cone) \\npermitted in Step 6 .  \\n5. Record the table number and standard,  i.e. FMVSS, CMVSS, F/CMVSS or SAE J \\nXXX and date, used as a Pass/Fail criteria on the data sheet.  Indicate whether the \\ndata  \\\"PASSED\\\" or FAILED\\\" all required acceptance criteria. \\nNOTE:  The following step, i.e. 6, must be  performed for: \\n1. all Certification tests where phot ometry evaluation is referenced, \\n2. but only for those DV tests in wh ich photometry is the only evaluation. \\nThe performance of Step 4 results in t he most upward glare region evaluation \\nbeing conducted with the commonly used interpretation, of measuring across an applicable  horizontal line and up a vertical  line at the point where the highest \\nreading on the applicable horizontal line wa s obtained.  This is more stringent \\nthan that used by NHTSA's contracted test labs, who in 1997 were discovered to go across the applicable horizontal line and up the vertical V line. \\nIn addition, instead of attempting to measure an infinite number of points in the \\nmost upward glare region, the Test Technician\\n will determine in Step 6 whether \\nany additional measurements need to be performed to evaluate any additional apparently excessively bright spots or ar eas of light that could be glaring enough \\nto be a safety concern. \\n6. Visually locate\\n within the region 10U to 90U - L to R any areas that are receiving \\nexcessively bright light. If such an area ex ists, scan the bright area to locate the \\napparent maximum intensity location and record the candlepower value and the position. Also record the candlepower va lue and position of all points within a 1 \\ndegree radius about the apparent maximum intensity location at 0.125 degree intervals. Find the actual highest intensity location by determining the center of the \\nhighest values obtained.  \\nActual highest intensity cd values that  are greater than 438 cd should be noted as \\nexceeding the maximum (FAIL), in addition, values exceeding 125 cd should also be \\nmarked as exceeding the maximum (FAIL), unless a 125 cd or lower value can be \\nfound within a 2 degree cone (1 degree reai m) around the actual highest intensity.  \\nNOTE:  The 2 degree cone is defined in  the rationale of  SAE J1383 JUN 90 and \\nalso in ECE R48 as the maximum area of spots of light that can exceed \\nthe maximum candlepower applied, i.e. 125 cd, to portions of the beam  All printed copies are uncontrolled.

Therefore, this criteria can confidently be used for, at least, all \\nheadlamps that are for 1999 model vehicles or later.  \\n7. For light sources other than incandescent light sources, measure and record the time \\n(in 0.1 seconds) to achieve nominal full brightness by energizing the bulb after the \\nlight source has fully cooled or has been o ff for a minimum of 30 minutes, whichever \\nis greater. \\n8. For headlamps which are aimed by moving the reflector relative to the lens and \\nheadlamp housing, or vice versa, or by aimi ng an internal lamp assembly relative to \\nthe external lens, repeat steps 5.1.1 (a) & (b) and ( c) 1) through 3) as appropriate \\nand 5.1.1(d) (1) through (5) at, 4U-V, 4D-V, and H-2.5L, and  H-2.5R.  At the test \\npositions, offset the goniometer to t he corresponding changes in aim position. \\nNOTE: IF the reflector moves relative to the lens and housing OR vice versa  \\nAND the headlamp is a Visual/Optical headlamp,  the headlamp may \\nbe photometered to the full range of vehicle pitch in the upward and \\ndownward directions, instead of at 4U-V, 4D-V .  The Product \\nEngineer must supply a pitch angle number and tolerance OR both upward and downward pitch angle numbers that he wants to certify the vehicle to.  The vehicle pitch number(s) submitted and used for testing should must be equal to or greater than the vehicle pitch number(s) of the vehicle approved fo r production.  A Visual/Optical \\nheadlamp must pass photometry at the full range of vehicle pitch .  \\nNOTE: Maximum variations of static vehicle pitch  (ref. FMVSS 108 S.7.8.3) \\nare to be obtained from the program engineering ride height information, but at this time only apply to: 1) to the maximum vertical \\nangles to which photometry must  comply for visual/optical \\nheadlamps. AND 2) the required maximum vertical adjustment angle in the laboratory for fixed lens/moveable reflector headlamps\\n. \\n(E) ECE Low Beam Measurement  \\n1.

Design voltage is the nominal voltage that t he vehicle will supply to the connector for the \\ncomponent.  North American Tail lamps are ty pically 14.0V and stop lamps are typically \\n12.8V.  However, ask the OEM to specify the nominal design voltage for the function \\nwhich could be different for the wiring, swit ching, resistors, voltage reduction modules \\netc. \\n  2. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage for 30 min, THEN run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with mi nimum requirements.   Also determine the \\nmaximum intensity location. \\n \\n3. Stabilize lamp to room temp and apply design voltage and IMMEDIATELY run the \\nphotometric test for all test points with maxi mum requirements within 60 seconds, that is \\nbetween 0 and 60.49 seconds).   \\n \\n4. For lamps like CHMSLs with a maximum zone (10L to 10R and from 10U to 5D) (typically \\nalso equal to the furthest test points), test the PREDETERMINED maximum location \\nwithin the zone.  Give a 1/4 degree reaim to any test point or maximum intensity location \\nthat exceeds that maximum permitted candela.   Any test measurement which exceeds \\nthe maximum shall be remeasured at a time approaching, but not exceeding 60.49 \\nseconds, i.e. 50-60 seconds, since test meas urements taken it the earlier part of the \\nallotted 60 seconds, i.e., 0-10 or even at  10-20 seconds, may be higher than would be \\nobtained later in the allotted time period.  If multiple test points have maximums, it is \\npermitted to repeat the test at many times as  necessary to test all test points with \\nmaximums within the latter portion of the allotted time, i.e., 50-60 seconds. \\n \\n5.

Since the certificati on laboratory  does not make either repeated single \\nsample measurements or multiple sample measurements using the same measurement \\nequipment and gages, nor are its measurement systems referenced as the measurement \\nsystems to be used in the customer approved c ontrol plan, the requirements for statistical \\nstudies for MSA [e.g. gage repeatability and r eproducibility (gage R & R) studies] do not \\napply to the Glendale Photometric Laboratory, nor  does the alternate requirement for other \\nanalytical methods and acceptance criteria that  are customer approved.  [Basis: Quality \\nSystem Requirements QS 9000, i.e.  the blue book, section 4.11.4].  \\nB) Visteon's customers in the automotive indus try do expect that the photometric laboratories \\nshall have adequate measurement systems to c onduct the required measurements.  This \\nincludes that the equipment used is appropriate  and calibrated.  Currently, the SAE is the \\naccepted industry body that defines appropr iate test equipment in SAE J1330 JUN 94 \\nPhotometric Laboratory Accura cy Guidelines.  The enumerated analysis that follows \\ndocuments our compliance with the latest SAE guidelines. \\n1. Light Intensity measurement is performed by using individual instruments that are \\ncalibrated for electronic performance.  T he measurement system contains several \\ninstruments , i.e. voltmeters and ammete rs both as readouts devices for intensity \\noutput and electrical input.  All instrument s are calibrated using calibration intervals \\nas specified by their manufacturer and all su ch calibrations are within the guidelines \\nof SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.8.1.  Thes e instruments form a system called a \\nphotometric measurement system  that is usually enclosed in a dark tunnel, i.e. a \\nphotometric tunnel.  The measurement syst em is calibrated per the G805WI-LL-C-\\n001 procedure to be traceable to NIST thr ough a series of primary, secondary and \\nworking standards. This calibration of the photometer system m eets the preferred \\nmethod of the guidelines for calibration contained within SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.7.5 and the requirements for calibration timi ng of sections 3.8.2.  and 3.8.3, except \\nthe annual recalibration in 3.8.3 has been replaced with a operating time based calibration, which is based on the interval recommended by the calibrating laboratory. \\nAs long as the instruments used to form the measurement system are in calibration \\nand the system itself is calibrated to  the traceable working standards, then the \\nphotometric tunnel readouts of intensity are calibrated and accurate to within the \\ntolerances that are considered acceptable for automotive \\\"photom etric laboratories\\\" \\nas defined by SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.  Note, use of these guidelines in some \\ninstances may \\\"result in equipment with unnecessary accuracy restrictions.\\\"  \\nTo minimize environmental factors, te mperature and humidity which affect both \\nelectrical and photometric measurement ar e controlled to 23 +/- 5 degrees C. and \\nhumidity is kept to = or < than 80%.  No  smoking is allowed in the laboratory and \\ncarpets and cleaning are used to control dust.  Air turbulence was minimized by facility design and temperature gradients ar e controlled by both the air conditioning \\nsystem and heaters within the photometric sensors, which k eep them at a relatively \\nconstant temperature; these measures reduce temperature gradients within the \\nmeasurement system to levels that  have been undetectable by the photometric \\nmeasurement system.  These controls ar e in accord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section \\n3.9. \\n2. The goniometer or positioner has a tole rance of = or < than 0.05 degrees in each \\naxis (per SAE J1330 section 3.1.3.2) and a resolution of = or > than +/- 0.01 degrees.  All printed copies are uncontrolled.  F650WILL-T001 \\nSee web (DOCMAN) for controlled copy.  Issued:  6/24/98   Revised:  08/31/00   Revision Level 4.0 \\nCONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 80 11/4/2011 (per SAE J1330 section 3.2.2).  Positioner accuracy is controlled by G805WI-LL-C-\\n001. \\n3. The overall accuracy of the light int ensity measurement system accuracy and the \\nspatial positioner accuracy is considered to be 5%.  Note, \\\"it is not possible to state  \\nthe specific accuracy for a photometric measurement system  as a function of angle \\naccuracy alone, as both the Positioner angul ar accuracy and the luminous intensity \\ngradient are involved.\\\"  Thus, \\\"The r epeatability of photometric measurements  stated \\nas a percent difference between laborat ories when measuring the same device \\ncannot be solely determined  as a function of the accuracy  of the Positioner system or \\ngoniometer.\\\" \\n4. Device positioning is controlled by fi xtures designed per G805S-001, which is in \\naccord with SAE J1330 JUN94 section 3.1.2 and controls the fixture to the \\\"designed \\nnominal position.\\\"  In addition, this work instruction (G805WI-LL-TP-001) controls the \\nlamp position to the \\\"designed nominal positi on\\\" by specifying that the major position \\nfactor of torque (for non-aimable lamps) is controlled by setting the lamp to the \\ninstallation torque specified by  product engineering per G805WI-001. \\n5. Power supplies, voltage measurement s, and current measurements are all \\nperformed with instruments purchased to meet the guidelines of SAE J1330 JUN94 \\nsections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. \\n6. Accurate rated bulbs whose designed lu minous flux (lumens) or mean spherical \\ncandlepower (mscp) is traceable to NIST ar e used in all test samples measured for \\nlight intensity.  These bulbs are reca librated per G805-LL-C-001in accord with SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.8.3, except the annual recalibration has been replaced with a \\noperating time based calibration, which is  based on the interval recommended by the \\ncalibrating laboratory. \\n7. Note, that  there are filament or light source parameters that are not controlled in \\naccurate rated bulbs and these parameter s in \\\"some lighting devices may produce \\nsignificantly different luminous intensity measurements with two different accurate \\nrated bulbs, particularly lighting devices wi th particularly short focal lengths.\\\" SAE \\nJ1330 JUN94 section 3.6). \\n8. The sensor/photometer system is desi gned and used within the guidelines for color \\nresponse, HID source use, range linearit y and sensor aperture size that are \\ncontained within SAE J1330 JUN94 sections 3. 7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3,  3.7.4 and 3.7.5.

The manufacturing plant will describe th ese process changes in th e Control Plan, along with \\neither (1) the revalidation plan th at would be followed in each case, or (2) a provision to submit an \\namended Control Plan for approval if any of those pr ocess changes are planned. No change to processing \\nmay be allowed without prior engineering approval of the process changes and the attendant Control Plan \\nchanges.   \\nB. DESIGN CHANGES - \\n Any changes in material or material sources must be revalidated for durability and material compatibility.  Any changes in material, design or tooling must be evaluated for their potential impact on: \\n1)  the real world safety of the vehicle,  \\n2)  the homologation status of the vehicle,  \\n3)  the self certification status  per FMVSS/CMVSS/ADR/etc.,  \\n4)  the ability to meet the customers safety design guidelines,  \\n5)  the crash performance of the vehicle and/or component and \\n6)  the customers safety related compliance requirements, i.e. WCR. \\n \\nThe potential impact of any of the above fact ors should be communicated  in writing to both: \\na)  the customer safety/regulatory representative via WERS or equivalent or email and  \\nb)  the Regulatory Compliance Engineer for Exterior Lighting  \\nwho shall provide assistance in determining what tests must be done (if any) to demonstrate that certification and/or homologation complia nce, safety factors/acceptance crite ria and safety related customer \\nrequirements have not been compromised.  \\n  \\nC.
